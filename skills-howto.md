Introduction: Why Skills Matter for Claude Code
Last week, I found myself repeatedly explaining to Claude how to format API documentation for our internal tools. Every conversation, the same setup. The same instructions. The same context-building before I could actually get work done.

Then I discovered Claude Code Skills—and everything changed.

Skills are Anthropic's answer to the problem of repetitive context-setting. Instead of treating Claude as a blank slate every time, you can package your expertise, workflows, and domain knowledge into reusable modules that Claude automatically discovers and applies when relevant.

📊 Stats Alert:

Claude Code has attracted 115,000 developers and processes 195 million lines of code weekly, according to PPC Land. With an estimated annualized revenue of $130 million, it represents one of the fastest-growing developer tools in the AI coding market.

According to Google's 2025 DORA Report, 90% of developers now use AI coding assistants, with 65% reporting heavy reliance on these tools. In 2025, 41% of all code is AI-generated or AI-assisted—making the ability to customize and extend AI capabilities more valuable than ever.

In this guide, I'll walk you through Anthropic's official skill-creator methodology—covering everything from core design principles to production deployment patterns.

💡 Quick Start: Don't want to create skills manually? Use our free Claude Code Skills Generator to instantly generate professional SKILL.md files with AI. Just enter your skill name and requirements, and download a ready-to-use .skill file.

🎯 Goal: Master the complete skill creation process: understand the architecture, apply core principles, and build production-ready skills that transform how you work with Claude.

Skills vs Sub-Agents vs MCP
Before diving into skills, it's important to understand how they compare to other Claude Code extension mechanisms:

Feature	Skills	Sub-Agents	MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Purpose	Extend Claude with specialized knowledge, workflows, and bundled resources	Spawn autonomous agent instances to handle complex sub-tasks	Connect to external tools and data sources via standardized protocol
Invocation	Model-invoked (automatic discovery based on context)	Explicitly spawned by parent agent	Tool calls to MCP servers
Persistence	Loaded into context when triggered	Run independently, return results	Stateless tool execution
Best For	Domain expertise, workflows, templates, scripts	Parallel task execution, research, exploration	External APIs, databases, file systems, third-party services
Context Usage	Progressive disclosure (metadata → instructions → resources)	Each sub-agent has own context	Minimal context (tool definitions only)
Complexity	Low (just SKILL.md + optional files)	Medium (requires orchestration)	Medium-High (requires server setup)
Examples	Code review guidelines, deployment workflows, brand standards	"Research this topic", "Explore the codebase"	GitHub API, database queries, Slack integration
💡 When to Use Each:

Skills: When you need Claude to follow specific procedures, use domain knowledge, or execute deterministic scripts repeatedly
Sub-Agents: When you need to parallelize work, delegate complex research, or isolate task context
MCP: When you need to interact with external systems, APIs, or real-time data sources
Skills are the simplest way to extend Claude's capabilities without external infrastructure—making them ideal for packaging team knowledge and workflows.

What Are Claude Code Skills?
Claude Code Skills structure overview from Anthropic
The Core Concept
Skills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as "onboarding guides" for specific domains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent equipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.

According to Anthropic's official skills repository, skills are designed to teach Claude how to complete specific objectives repeatedly—whether that's applying brand guidelines to documents, executing organizational workflows, or automating personal processes.

💡 Expert Insight:

The fundamental innovation of Skills is efficiency. Instead of spending tokens on repeated instructions, you package expertise once and let Claude activate it automatically when relevant. It's the difference between training someone every day versus hiring an expert who already knows the job.

What Skills Provide
Capability	Description
Specialized Workflows	Multi-step procedures for specific domains
Tool Integrations	Instructions for working with file formats or APIs
Domain Expertise	Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
Bundled Resources	Scripts, references, and assets for complex tasks
Key Characteristics
Feature	Description
Model-Invoked	Claude automatically discovers and activates skills based on task context
Progressive Disclosure	Three-tier loading: metadata always loaded, instructions on-demand, resources as-needed
Self-Contained	Each skill is a complete package with everything needed
Portable	Same format works across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API
Shareable	Distribute via git repositories or plugins
Core Design Principles
Before diving into implementation, understand the three principles that separate effective skills from bloated ones.

Principle 1: Concise is Key
The context window is a public good. Skills share it with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other skills' metadata, and the actual user request.

Default assumption: Claude is already very smart. Only add context Claude doesn't already have.

Challenge each piece of information:

"Does Claude really need this explanation?"
"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?"
📌 Pro Tip:

Prefer concise examples over verbose explanations. A single well-crafted example communicates more than paragraphs of description—and costs fewer tokens.

Principle 2: Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom
Match the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:

Freedom Level	When to Use	Implementation
High	Multiple valid approaches, context-dependent decisions	Text-based instructions
Medium	Preferred pattern exists, some variation acceptable	Pseudocode or parameterized scripts
Low	Fragile operations, consistency critical	Specific scripts, few parameters
💡 Expert Insight:

Think of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom). Match your skill's guidance to the terrain.

Principle 3: Progressive Disclosure
Skills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:

Level 1 - Metadata (Always Loaded)

Name and description in YAML frontmatter
~100 tokens per skill
Enables discovery without consuming context
Level 2 - SKILL.md Body (When Triggered)

Main instructions and procedures
Target under 500 lines / 5k tokens
Loaded when Claude determines skill is relevant
Level 3 - Bundled Resources (As Needed)

Scripts, references, assets
Unlimited capacity
Scripts can execute without loading into context
⚠️ Warning: Keep SKILL.md body to essentials and under 500 lines. If approaching this limit, split content into separate reference files. This prevents context bloat while maintaining capability.

Anatomy of a Skill
SKILL.md file anatomy and structure
Required Structure
Every skill follows this structure:

skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/     - Executable code
    ├── references/  - Documentation for context
    └── assets/      - Files for output (templates, etc.)
SKILL.md Format
---
name: your-skill-name
description: What this skill does and when to use it. Include trigger contexts, file types, task types, and keywords users might mention.
---
 
# Your Skill Name
 
[Instructions section]
Clear, step-by-step guidance for Claude.
 
[Examples section]
Concrete input/output examples.
Frontmatter Requirements
Field	Required	Constraints
name	Yes	Lowercase, hyphens allowed, max 64 chars
description	Yes	Max 1024 chars, must include WHAT and WHEN
⚠️ Critical: The description field is the primary triggering mechanism. Include both what the skill does AND specific triggers/contexts for when to use it. The body is only loaded after triggering—putting "When to Use" sections in the body is ineffective.

Bundled Resources
Bundling additional content in Claude Code Skills
Scripts (scripts/)
Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks requiring deterministic reliability.

When to include:

Same code being rewritten repeatedly
Deterministic reliability needed
Complex operations prone to errors
Benefits:

Token efficient
Deterministic results
Can execute without loading into context
# Example: scripts/rotate_pdf.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Rotate PDF pages by specified degrees."""
 
import argparse
from pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter
 
def rotate_pdf(input_path, output_path, degrees):
    reader = PdfReader(input_path)
    writer = PdfWriter()
 
    for page in reader.pages:
        page.rotate(degrees)
        writer.add_page(page)
 
    with open(output_path, "wb") as f:
        writer.write(f)
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("input", help="Input PDF path")
    parser.add_argument("output", help="Output PDF path")
    parser.add_argument("--degrees", type=int, default=90)
    args = parser.parse_args()
    rotate_pdf(args.input, args.output, args.degrees)
References (references/)
Documentation loaded as needed into context.

When to include:

Database schemas
API documentation
Domain knowledge
Company policies
Detailed workflow guides
Best practice: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md.

📌 Pro Tip:

Information should live in either SKILL.md or references—not both. Keep only essential procedural instructions in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material to references files. This keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable.

Assets (assets/)
Files not loaded into context but used in output.

When to include:

Templates (PowerPoint, documents)
Brand assets (logos, images)
Boilerplate code
Fonts
Benefits: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them.

What NOT to Include
A skill should only contain essential files. Do NOT create:

README.md
INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md
QUICK_REFERENCE.md
CHANGELOG.md
The skill should contain only what an AI agent needs to do the job—not auxiliary context about creation, setup procedures, or user-facing documentation.

The Six-Step Skill Creation Process
Progressive disclosure model for Claude Code Skills
Step 1: Understand with Concrete Examples
Skip only when usage patterns are already clearly understood.

To create an effective skill, gather concrete examples of how it will be used. Ask questions like:

"What functionality should this skill support?"
"Can you give examples of how this skill would be used?"
"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?"
💡 Expert Insight:

Don't overwhelm users with questions. Start with the most important ones and follow up as needed. Conclude when you have a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.

Example for an image-editor skill:

User might say: "Remove the red-eye from this image"
User might say: "Rotate this image 90 degrees"
User might say: "Resize this photo to 800x600"
Step 2: Plan Reusable Contents
Analyze each example by:

Considering how to execute the example from scratch
Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would help when executing repeatedly
Example Analysis:

Skill	Example Query	Analysis	Resource Needed
pdf-editor	"Rotate this PDF"	Requires rewriting same code each time	scripts/rotate_pdf.py
frontend-builder	"Build me a todo app"	Requires same boilerplate each time	assets/hello-world/ template
bigquery	"How many users logged in?"	Requires rediscovering schemas	references/schema.md
📌 Pro Tip: Want to skip the manual setup? Our free Claude Skills Generator can create the initial SKILL.md structure for you in seconds. Just describe your skill, and AI will generate a properly-formatted file ready for customization.

Step 3: Initialize the Skill
When creating from scratch, use Anthropic's initialization script:

scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>
The script:

Creates the skill directory at specified path
Generates SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter
Creates example resource directories
Adds example files that can be customized or deleted
Manual initialization alternative:

mkdir -p my-skill/{scripts,references,assets}
touch my-skill/SKILL.md
Step 4: Edit the Skill
Remember: you're creating this for another instance of Claude to use. Include information that would be beneficial and non-obvious.

Start with Reusable Contents
Implement the scripts, references, and assets identified in Step 2.

Important: Test all scripts by actually running them. If there are many similar scripts, test a representative sample to ensure they work.

Delete any example files not needed for the skill.

Write the SKILL.md
Writing guideline: Always use imperative/infinitive form.

Frontmatter example:

---
name: docx-processor
description: Comprehensive document creation, editing, and analysis with support for tracked changes, comments, formatting preservation, and text extraction. Use when Claude needs to work with professional documents (.docx files) for: (1) Creating new documents, (2) Modifying or editing content, (3) Working with tracked changes, (4) Adding comments, or any other document tasks.
---
Body structure:

# Skill Name
 
## Getting Started
[Essential first steps]
 
## Core Workflows
[Step-by-step procedures]
 
## Extended Capabilities
- **Feature A**: See [FEATURE_A.md](references/feature_a.md)
- **Feature B**: See [FEATURE_B.md](references/feature_b.md)
 
## Examples
[Concrete input/output pairs]
Step 5: Package the Skill
Once development is complete, package into a distributable .skill file:

scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>
Optional output directory:

scripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist
The packaging script:

Validates the skill automatically:

YAML frontmatter format and required fields
Naming conventions and directory structure
Description completeness and quality
File organization and resource references
Packages if validation passes, creating a .skill file (zip format)

If validation fails, fix errors and run again.

Step 6: Iterate Based on Usage
Skills improve through real-world usage:

Use the skill on real tasks
Notice struggles or inefficiencies
Identify updates needed to SKILL.md or resources
Implement changes and test again
📌 Pro Tip:

Iteration often happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how it performed. Capture improvement ideas immediately while they're vivid.

Advanced Skill Patterns
This section covers advanced patterns for organizing and structuring your skills effectively.

Progressive Disclosure Patterns
Pattern 1: High-Level Guide with References
# PDF Processing
 
## Quickstart
Extract text with pdfplumber:
[code example]
 
## Additional Capabilities
- **Form filling**: See [FORMS.md](references/forms.md)
- **API reference**: See [REFERENCE.md](references/reference.md)
- **Examples**: See [EXAMPLES.md](references/examples.md)
Claude loads reference files only when needed.

Pattern 2: Domain-Specific Organization
For skills with multiple domains, organize by domain:

bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview and navigation)
└── references/
    ├── finance.md (revenue, billing metrics)
    ├── sales.md (opportunities, pipeline)
    ├── product.md (API usage, features)
    └── marketing.md (campaigns, attribution)
When user asks about sales metrics, Claude only reads sales.md.

Pattern 3: Framework/Variant Organization
For skills supporting multiple frameworks:

cloud-deploy/
├── SKILL.md (workflow + provider selection)
└── references/
    ├── aws.md (AWS deployment patterns)
    ├── gcp.md (GCP deployment patterns)
    └── azure.md (Azure deployment patterns)
When user chooses AWS, Claude only reads aws.md.

Pattern 4: Conditional Details
Show basic content, link to advanced:

# DOCX Processing
 
## Creating Documents
 
Use docx-js for new documents. See [DOCX-JS.md](references/docx-js.md).
 
## Editing Documents
 
For simple edits, modify the XML directly.
 
**For tracked changes**: See [REDLINING.md](references/redlining.md)
**For OOXML details**: See [OOXML.md](references/ooxml.md)
Important Guidelines
Avoid deeply nested references - Keep references one level deep from SKILL.md
Structure longer files - For files >100 lines, include a table of contents at top
Workflow Patterns
Sequential Workflows
For complex multi-step tasks, break work into distinct steps with upfront overview:

## Filling a PDF Form
 
This process involves 5 steps:
 
1. Analyze the form structure
2. Create field mapping
3. Validate the mapping
4. Fill the form
5. Verify the output
 
### Step 1: Analyze the Form
 
[Detailed instructions]
 
### Step 2: Create Field Mapping
 
[Detailed instructions]
...
Conditional Workflows
For tasks with decision branches:

## Document Processing
 
First, determine the task type:
 
- **Creating new document**: Go to Section A
- **Editing existing document**: Go to Section B
- **Converting format**: Go to Section C
 
### Section A: Creating New Documents
 
[Specific steps for creation]
 
### Section B: Editing Existing Documents
 
[Specific steps for editing]
...
Output Patterns
Template Pattern (Strict)
For scenarios demanding precision:

## Report Format
 
ALWAYS use this exact structure:
 
### Executive Summary
 
[2-3 sentences summarizing findings]
 
### Key Findings
 
1. [Finding with supporting data]
2. [Finding with supporting data]
 
### Recommendations
 
- [Actionable recommendation]
- [Actionable recommendation]
Template Pattern (Flexible)
When adaptation adds value:

## Analysis Format
 
Use this suggested structure, adjusting as needed:
 
- **Overview**: Context and scope
- **Analysis**: Key observations
- **Insights**: Patterns and implications
- **Next Steps**: Recommended actions
 
Use your best judgment on section depth and detail.
Examples Pattern
For stylistic consistency, include input/output pairs:

## Commit Message Examples
 
**Input**: Added user authentication
**Output**: feat(auth): implement JWT-based user authentication
 
**Input**: Fixed bug in payment processing
**Output**: fix(payments): resolve race condition in checkout flow
 
**Input**: Updated dependencies
**Output**: chore(deps): bump axios to 1.6.0, update lodash
💡 Expert Insight:

Examples help Claude understand desired style and detail more clearly than descriptions alone. When output quality depends on stylistic consistency, invest in good examples.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is a Claude Code Skill?

A skill is a modular package containing instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude can discover and load dynamically. It transforms Claude from a general-purpose assistant into a specialized agent for specific tasks.

How does Claude discover my skill?

Claude reads skill metadata (name and description) at startup. When a request matches the description, Claude loads the full SKILL.md and follows its instructions. This is called "progressive disclosure."

Where should I store my skills?

Personal skills go in ~/.claude/skills/ for cross-project use. Project skills go in .claude/skills/ to share with team members via git.

What's the difference between skills and slash commands?

Slash commands are user-invoked (/command) and execute immediately. Skills are model-invoked—Claude automatically discovers and uses them based on context. Skills are better for complex, multi-step capabilities.

How do I restrict what tools a skill can use?

Add allowed-tools to your YAML frontmatter. For example: allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Grep prevents file modifications while allowing read operations.

What should I put in the description field?

Include both WHAT the skill does and WHEN to use it. Add trigger contexts, file types, task types, and keywords users might mention. This is the primary mechanism for skill discovery.

How long should SKILL.md be?

Keep it under 500 lines. If approaching this limit, split content into reference files. Link to them clearly from SKILL.md so Claude knows they exist.

Can skills include executable code?

Yes. Put scripts in the scripts/ directory. These can be Python, Bash, or any executable. Scripts provide deterministic reliability and can execute without loading into context.

How do I debug a skill that isn't working?

Check that YAML frontmatter is valid, description includes relevant trigger words, and the file is in the correct location. Ask Claude "What skills are available?" to verify discovery.

Can I share skills with my team?

Yes. Store skills in .claude/skills/ within your project and commit to git. Team members who clone the repository automatically have access.
