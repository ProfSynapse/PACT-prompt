description: Triage after hitting blocker (Is help and/or a redo needed?)

You hit a blocker: $ARGUMENTS

Triage with two questions:

1. **Redo prior phase?** — Is the issue upstream in P→A→C→T?
2. **Additional agents needed?** — Do we need help beyond the blocked agent's scope/specialty?

Two possible outcomes:
- **Redo prior phase**: Re-delegate to the relevant agent(s) to redo the appropriate prior phase (P→A→C→T)
- **Augment present phase**: Re-invoke the blocked agent with additional context along with additional agents in parallel to assist in the present phase

If neither question is "Yes," the agent wasn't truly blocked—instruct them to continue with clarified guidance.

**Remember**: As orchestrator, diagnose and delegate—never execute the fix yourself.
