description: Handle work solo with PACT phase-aware thinking (single-agent PACT)
argument-hint: [e.g., fix typo, change wording, update dependencies]

Handle this solo using comPACT workflow: $ARGUMENTS

Apply PACT thinking as a single agent—no multi-agent orchestration needed.

**Scale ceremony to complexity:**
- Simple work (typo, config): Principles applied naturally—understand, consider, change, verify
- Complex-but-contained work: Explicit hat-switching through Prepare → Architect → Code → Test

**Escalate to `/PACT:orchestrate` if:**
- Work spans multiple specialist domains
- Architectural decisions affect multiple components
- You realize you can't handle it well solo

Your work isn't done until tests pass.
