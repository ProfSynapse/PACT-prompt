## Summary

Break up the 1,085-line `pact-protocols.md` into targeted files so agents and commands import only the context they need. This moderate approach extracts **2 new files** while keeping `pact-protocols.md` as the orchestrator reference—achieving ~85% context reduction for agents with minimal maintenance overhead.

---

## Problem Statement

**Current state:** Every PACT agent and command that references `pact-protocols.md` loads all 1,085 lines regardless of what they actually need:

| Consumer | What They Need | What They Load | Waste |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| 7 Agents | S1 Autonomy (~75 lines) | 1,085 lines | ~93% |
| plan-mode.md | Variety (~60 lines) | 1,085 lines | ~94% |
| orchestrate.md | Multiple sections | 1,085 lines | Varies |

**Goal:** Enable targeted imports so agents load ~100 lines instead of 1,085.

---

## Specialist Perspectives

### 📋 Preparation Phase
**Effort**: Low

#### Research Completed
- [x] File sizes measured (pact-protocols.md = 1,085 lines)
- [x] Reference patterns analyzed (**21 @-references across 11 files**)
- [x] Agent-specific sections identified (S1 Autonomy, Self-Coordination, Algedonic pointer)
- [x] Existing patterns confirmed (algedonic.md already extracted—proves pattern works)

#### Dependencies to Map

| File | Reference Count | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| 7 agent files | 14 total (2 each) | Cross-Agent Coordination + Nested PACT |
| `pact-preparer.md` | 3 refs (exception) | Has additional S4 Environment Model ref → **stays pointing to main file** |
| `orchestrate.md` | 6 refs | Only Variety Management ref changes; S4/S2/S3* refs stay |
| `plan-mode.md` | 1 ref | Variety Management |
| `algedonic.md` | 1 ref | S5 Decision Framing → stays pointing to main file |
| `vsm-glossary.md` | 1 ref | General reference → stays pointing to main file |
| `pact-plugin/` | mirrors | Must mirror all changes to protocols/ and agents/ |

**Total edits required**: ~32 files (14 agent edits + 2 command edits + 2 protocol files + pact-plugin mirrors)

---

### 🏗️ Architecture Phase
**Effort**: Low

#### Proposed File Structure

```
~/.claude/protocols/
├── pact-protocols.md        # Refactored: Orchestrator reference (~950 lines)
├── pact-agent-protocols.md  # NEW: For all agents (~100 lines)
├── pact-variety.md          # NEW: For orchestrate/plan-mode (~80 lines)
└── algedonic.md             # Unchanged (already extracted)
```

#### Content Distribution

| File | Content | Lines | Consumers |
|------|---------|-------|-----------|
| **pact-agent-protocols.md** (NEW) | S1 Autonomy & Recursion (full), Self-Coordination (from S2), Phase Handoffs, Algedonic quick-ref | ~100 | All 7 agents |
| **pact-variety.md** (NEW) | Variety Management (full), PACT Workflow Family table | ~80 | orchestrate.md, plan-mode.md |
| **pact-protocols.md** (refactored) | S5 Policy, S4 Checkpoints, S3/S4 Tension, S2 Coordination (minus Self-Coordination), S3* Audit, Workflow protocols, Decision logs, Documentation locations | ~950 | Orchestrator only |

#### Design Approach

**Consumer-aligned partitioning**: Group content by who needs it rather than by VSM system. This is the simplest mental model:
- "Agent file" = What agents need to know
- "Variety file" = What commands need for workflow selection
- "Main file" = Orchestrator's complete reference

#### Key Decisions

| Decision | Options | Recommendation | Rationale |
|----------|---------|----------------|-----------|
| How many files? | 2 new / 4 new / 8 new | **2 new** | Truly moderate; highest ROI with lowest overhead |
| Naming convention | VSM-aligned / Consumer-aligned | **Consumer-aligned** | More intuitive (`pact-agent-protocols` vs `s1-autonomy`) |
| What stays in main file? | Everything else / Slim index only | **Everything else** | Orchestrator still benefits from having full reference |

#### Interface Contracts

**Each new file includes back-reference header:**
```markdown
# {Title}

> **Purpose**: {One line}
> **Referenced by**: {Consumer list}
> **See also**: @~/.claude/protocols/pact-protocols.md for full orchestration protocols
```

**Main file includes forward reference table** (add to `pact-protocols.md` header):
```markdown
## Extracted Protocols (For Specific Consumers)

Some protocols are maintained in separate files for context efficiency:

| Protocol | File | Primary Consumer |
|----------|------|------------------|
| Agent Autonomy & Coordination | `pact-agent-protocols.md` | All specialist agents |
| Variety Management | `pact-variety.md` | orchestrate.md, plan-mode.md |
| Emergency Signals | `algedonic.md` | All agents + orchestrator |
```

This bidirectional referencing ensures discoverability from either direction.

### 💻 Code Phase
**Effort**: Low-Medium

#### Files to Create

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.claude/protocols/pact-agent-protocols.md` | Agent-focused protocols: autonomy, coordination, handoffs |
| `.claude/protocols/pact-variety.md` | Variety scoring and workflow selection |

#### Files to Modify

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `.claude/protocols/pact-protocols.md` | Add index header pointing to extracted files; minor cleanup |
| `.claude/agents/pact-architect.md` | Update refs: `pact-protocols.md` → `pact-agent-protocols.md` |
| `.claude/agents/pact-backend-coder.md` | Update refs: `pact-protocols.md` → `pact-agent-protocols.md` |
| `.claude/agents/pact-frontend-coder.md` | Update refs: `pact-protocols.md` → `pact-agent-protocols.md` |
| `.claude/agents/pact-database-engineer.md` | Update refs: `pact-protocols.md` → `pact-agent-protocols.md` |
| `.claude/agents/pact-test-engineer.md` | Update refs: `pact-protocols.md` → `pact-agent-protocols.md` |
| `.claude/agents/pact-preparer.md` | Update 2 of 3 refs → `pact-agent-protocols.md`; S4 Environment Model ref stays pointing to main file |
| `.claude/agents/pact-n8n.md` | Update refs: `pact-protocols.md` → `pact-agent-protocols.md` |
| `.claude/commands/PACT/orchestrate.md` | Update variety refs → `pact-variety.md` |
| `.claude/commands/PACT/plan-mode.md` | Update variety refs → `pact-variety.md` |
| `pact-plugin/protocols/` | Mirror new protocol files |
| `pact-plugin/agents/` | Mirror agent reference updates |

#### Implementation Sequence

1. Create `pact-agent-protocols.md` with extracted content
2. Create `pact-variety.md` with extracted content
3. Add index header to `pact-protocols.md` pointing to new files
4. Update all 7 agent files (parallel-safe: different files)
5. Update orchestrate.md and plan-mode.md
6. Sync to pact-plugin/ directory

### 🧪 Test Phase
**Effort**: Low

#### Test Scenarios

| Scenario | Type | Priority |
|----------|------|----------|
| All @-references resolve to existing files | Validation | P0 |
| All section-level references find target sections | Validation | P0 |
| No content lost during extraction | Validation | P0 |
| Agent can read `pact-agent-protocols.md` | Smoke | P0 |
| orchestrate.md can read `pact-variety.md` | Smoke | P0 |
| pact-preparer S4 Environment Model ref still works | Smoke | P0 |
| orchestrate.md S4/S2/S3* refs still work (unchanged) | Smoke | P0 |
| No duplicate content across files | Validation | P1 |
| pact-plugin/ mirrors match .claude/ | Validation | P1 |

#### Coverage Targets
- Reference resolution: 100%
- Content preservation: 100% (verified by diff)

#### Validation Approach

**Hybrid**: Automated grep for reference inventory + manual spot-check of key consumers

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s globstar  # Required for **/*.md pattern

# Pre-change baseline
grep -r "@~/.claude/protocols" .claude/ pact-plugin/ > baseline-refs.txt

# Post-change validation with proper exit codes
broken=0

# Check file-level references
for ref in $(grep -roh "@~/.claude/protocols/[^)\" ]*" .claude/ pact-plugin/); do
  filepath="${ref#@}"
  filepath="${filepath/#\~/$HOME}"
  if [[ ! -f "$filepath" ]]; then
    echo "BROKEN FILE: $ref"
    broken=1
  fi
done

# Check section-level references (verify section headers exist in target files)
# Pattern matches: "for S1 Autonomy" or "for the Variety Management"
for file in .claude/**/*.md pact-plugin/**/*.md; do
  [[ -f "$file" ]] || continue
  while IFS= read -r line; do
    section=$(echo "$line" | grep -oP 'for (the )?\K[A-Z][^.]*(?= (rules|protocol|section|assessment))' || true)
    target=$(echo "$line" | grep -oP '@~/.claude/protocols/[^)\" ]*' | head -1 || true)
    if [[ -n "$section" && -n "$target" ]]; then
      target_path="${target#@}"
      target_path="${target_path/#\~/$HOME}"
      if [[ -f "$target_path" ]] && ! grep -q "## .*$section" "$target_path" 2>/dev/null; then
        echo "MISSING SECTION: '$section' not found in $target_path (from $file)"
        broken=1
      fi
    fi
  done < <(grep "@~/.claude/protocols" "$file" 2>/dev/null || true)
done

exit $broken
```

**Key validation improvements**:
- Includes both `.claude/` and `pact-plugin/` directories
- Uses `globstar` for recursive file matching
- Returns proper exit code for CI integration
- Validates section-level references (not just file existence)

### Commit Sequence (Proposed)

> **Note**: This sequence represents the intended final git history order, **not** the execution order. Independent commits may be implemented in parallel.

1. `feat(protocols): extract agent-focused protocols to pact-agent-protocols.md` — S1 Autonomy, Self-Coordination, Phase Handoffs
2. `feat(protocols): extract variety management to pact-variety.md` — Variety scoring, workflow family
3. `refactor(protocols): add index header to pact-protocols.md` — Point to extracted files
4. `refactor(agents): update 7 agent files with targeted protocol refs` — All agents use new file
5. `refactor(commands): update orchestrate and plan-mode with targeted refs` — Commands use variety file
6. `chore(plugin): sync protocol and agent changes to pact-plugin/` — Mirror for distribution

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

| Concern | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Security | N/A | No security implications |
| Performance | Ready | This is a context reduction optimization |
| Accessibility | N/A | Documentation only |
| Observability | N/A | No runtime implications |

---

## Open Questions

### Require User Decision

None — straightforward moderate optimization with clear scope.

### Require Further Research

- [ ] **Token measurement**: How to verify actual token savings post-implementation? (Can defer to TEST phase)

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Broken @-references after update | Low | High | Pre-change baseline + automated validation script |
| Content lost during extraction | Low | Medium | Section-by-section diff before/after |
| Increased maintenance overhead | Low | Low | Only 2 new files; clear purposes |
| Agent needs content not in extracted file | Low | Medium | Include all agent-relevant sections; main file remains available |

---

## Expected Outcomes

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Agent context load | 1,085 lines | ~100 lines | **~90% reduction** |
| plan-mode context load | 1,085 lines | ~80 lines | **~93% reduction** |
| orchestrate.md (variety refs) | 1,085 lines | ~80 lines | **~93% reduction** |
| Files to maintain | 1 | 3 | +2 files (moderate overhead) |
| Total protocol lines | 1,085 | 1,085 | No loss (redistributed) |

---

## Scope Assessment

- **Overall Complexity**: Low-Medium
- **New Files**: 2 protocol files + 2 plugin mirrors = 4 files
- **Modified Files**: 7 agents (14 ref edits) + 2 commands + 1 pact-protocols.md + 7 plugin agent mirrors + 1 plugin pact-protocols = ~18 files
- **Total File Touches**: ~22 files (some with multiple edits)
- **Total Edits**: ~32 (14 agent refs + 2 command refs + headers/content extraction + plugin mirrors)
- **Specialists Required**: pact-preparer (minimal), orchestrator for file edits
- **External Dependencies**: None
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours implementation + 1 hour validation

---

## Comparison to Previous Plan

This plan supersedes the more comprehensive `context-architecture-protocols-plan.md` (PR #71):

| Aspect | Previous Plan | This Plan |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| New files | 8 | 2 |
| Scope | Full VSM-aligned partitioning | Consumer-aligned extraction |
| Complexity | High | Low-Medium |
| Maintenance overhead | High | Low |
| Agent savings | ~90% | ~90% |
| Time estimate | 6-7 hours | 2-3 hours |

**Trade-off**: Similar agent context savings with ~60% less implementation effort and ongoing maintenance.

---

## Next Steps

To implement this plan after approval:
```
/PACT:orchestrate implement moderate context optimization per approved plan
```

The orchestrator should reference this plan during execution.

---

## Revision History

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-01-15 | Initial plan created via `/PACT:plan-mode` |
| 2026-01-15 | Peer review feedback incorporated: fixed reference count (21 across 11 files), added missing dependencies, documented pact-preparer special case, enhanced validation script, added forward/back reference requirements, documented total edit count |
