"""A PRIMARY frame with no ``--agent`` must keep the orchestrator ladder.

THE DEFECT THESE ARMS CLOSE. ``classify_session_role`` returns "unknown" when
``agent_type`` is ABSENT, and its own docstring names what that covers: "a
non-PACT / no-``--agent`` primary frame". A role gate that SUPPRESSES the
orchestrator ladder for "unknown" therefore suppresses it for every user who
runs plain ``claude``. That user is not told to bootstrap, so the bootstrap
marker is never stamped, so ``bootstrap_gate`` (PreToolUse, no matcher key,
runs on EVERY tool call) denies Edit, Write and Agent. The user reads that as a
total tool-load failure.

THE SUPPRESSION ALSO CANNOT REACH THE FRAMES IT WAS BUILT FOR, WHICH IS WHY
THESE ARMS ASSERT A RESTORE RATHER THAN A NARROWING. Its stated target was
subagent frames that received the orchestrator instructions. MEASURED, with the
parameter beside the count. POPULATION: 166 files matching ``subagents/*.jsonl``
for one team session. 13 of them carry a SessionStart record, and those records
hold 70 SessionStart entries. EVERY ONE of the 70 has ``type == "attachment"``
and carries the LEAD session id, not a subagent session id: the set of distinct
session ids across all 70 has exactly ONE member and it is the lead. They are
the LEAD's own hook output, which the platform attaches into the transcripts of
the sidechains that are live at that moment. Those frames classify "lead", so
they take the lead branch in either version, and a gate keyed on "unknown"
cannot change one byte of them. NO SUBAGENT FRAME REACHES THIS HOOK: 150 of the
166 files hold no SessionStart record of any kind.

WHAT THE NOTICE IS FOR, AND WHY IT IS ADDITIVE. ``_UNKNOWN_ROLE_NOTICE`` tells
an operator who MEANT to launch the orchestrator and forgot the flag. That cue
is worth keeping. It is emitted BESIDE the ladder, never in place of it,
because the cost of withholding the ladder is a denied user and the cost of the
notice is a few hundred bytes.

THE ARMING PROBLEM THESE ARMS ANSWER. ``session_init`` is fail-open by
contract, so a hook that emits nothing and a hook that ran and correctly said
nothing produce the same bytes, which are none. AN ARM THAT ASSERTS ONLY AN
ABSENCE CANNOT SEPARATE THOSE TWO STATES. Every arm below asserts a PRESENCE
and an ABSENCE together, so the absence half is measured inside a run that
provably reached the emission point.
