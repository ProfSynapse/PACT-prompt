Summary: Arms for the shredded-list-field detector. Each arm below names
the implementation it goes RED against, because a green arm with no named
mutant retires a question instead of answering it.

THE THREE ARMS THAT CARRY THE MOST WEIGHT:

1. `TestBlindImplementations` holds the two probes a reasonable author
   would write, and proves each one MISSES damage that the tool finds. The
   shape probe over string lists misses all three dict fields. The
   longest-leaf probe misses `active_tasks`, because that dataclass always
   emits `status="pending"`, whose text length is 7. Delete the per-field
   extractor and these arms go red.

2. `TestTheTwoReadingsOfTheSignature` holds a record whose qualifying items
   are INTERLEAVED with healthy prose, so the TOTAL count fires and the
   LONGEST CONSECUTIVE run does not. Change the tool to fire on the
   consecutive run and this arm goes red. The live store cannot supply this
   record, so the fixture is the only place the ruling is checkable.

3. `TestReadOnlyByMechanism` proves the refusal, not the intent. The tool
   stops when a `-wal` or `-shm` sidecar is present, and the store bytes
   are identical after a scan.

CONTROLS. Every negative assertion below runs after a positive control on
the same fixture, so an empty answer cannot come from an empty input.

WHY NO ARM PINS THE TEN KNOWN DAMAGED RECORD IDS. Those ids are a check on
a LIVE run, not a specification. An arm that pins them reports an
environment change as a code defect the first time a record is repaired or
an eleventh record is damaged. The live comparison belongs in the run
record, not in this file.

        `database.LIST_FIELDS` and the detector omits that column from its
