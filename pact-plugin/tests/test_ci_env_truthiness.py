WHAT THIS PINS
    `memory_init._ci_is_declared()` decides whether
    `check_and_install_dependencies()` takes its `skipped_ci` branch (report
    drift, install nothing) or proceeds to a network `pip install`.

    That decision used to be `os.environ.get('CI')`, which is TRUE for every
    non-empty string — so `CI=false`, `CI=0` and `CI=no` all meant "yes, this
    is CI". The direction was fail-safe (it skipped an install rather than
    performing one unasked), which is why this was a correctness defect rather
    than an urgent one, but the check did not mean what it said.

WHY THE SPELLINGS ARE ENUMERATED RATHER THAN DESCRIBED
    A truthiness bug is invisible in the source: `if os.environ.get('CI')`
    looks exactly like a correct check. Only a case naming a falsy spelling
    distinguishes the two implementations, so the spellings are listed here as
    inputs. A test asserting merely that "CI=true is CI" passes against the
    defect as happily as against the fix.

    The two behavioural arms at the bottom exist for the same reason: they tie
    the predicate to the branch it actually controls, so a future refactor that
    keeps `_ci_is_declared` correct while wiring it up wrongly still fails.
