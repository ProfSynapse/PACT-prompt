"""The `agent_handoff` ordering rule rests on a CALLER property. Enforce it.

WHAT RESTS ON THIS. The harvest resolves a multi-event `agent_handoff` group
by taking the latest `ts`, and `session_resume` does the same when it renders
its Completed Work summary. Both compare `ts` AS A STRING. A string compare
orders timestamps correctly only while every event of the family carries ONE
format.

WHY THAT IS A CALLER PROPERTY AND NOT A SCHEMA PROPERTY, WHICH IS THE WHOLE
CAUSE FOR THIS FILE. `session_journal.make_event` stamps its own timestamp
through `setdefault("ts", ...)`, so A CALLER-SUPPLIED `ts` IS PRESERVED. The
schema does not reject one and nothing warns. The one-format property
thus belongs to the CALLERS, and it holds today only because neither
`agent_handoff` emit path passes a `ts` of its own.

THE FAILURE IS SILENT AND IT RUNS IN EITHER DIRECTION. `make_event` stamps a
Z-suffix form and `canonical_since()` emits an offset form. MEASURED:
`ord('+')` is 43 and `ord('Z')` is 90, so for two spellings of ONE instant
the offset form sorts as OLDER. AND THE COMMON SHORT FORM OF THIS HAZARD,
that an offset form always sorts as older, IS TOO STRONG: a string compare
walks left to right, so the DATETIME PREFIX decides first and the suffix
decides nothing until every byte before it is equal. A non-UTC offset naming
the same instant carries a different hour and sorts as NEWER. The accurate
statement is that a mixed-format set is ordered BY BYTES AND NOT BY TIME.
Either way the latest-wins rule can keep the incorrect event, and no test in
the family reddens.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES AND DOES NOT DO. It converts correct-by-a-caller-property
into the caller property ENFORCED: a future edit that passes a `ts` to either
emit path turns this RED at the moment it is written. It does NOT make the
comparison safe against a mixed set.

🔴 THE LOAD-BEARING ASSERTION IN THIS FILE IS THE CALLER-PROPERTY ARM, AND
THE BYTE-RULE ARM IS AN EXPLANATION OF WHAT IS LOST IF THAT PROPERTY GOES.
Read them in that order. If a caller ever does pass a `ts`, the answer is to
PARSE the two values, not to reach for a rule about which byte decides. That
instruction is the one part of this warning that has needed no correction
across three rounds of review: a claim, then a rule replacing the claim, then
a precondition replacing the rule, each complete across its own list of
spellings and each broken by the next probe.

        A list of spellings keeps growing, and an arm that pins five pairs
        goes stale the moment a sixth spelling arrives while reporting
        green. So this asserts the ORDERING FUNCTION: at ONE datetime
        prefix, the string order of the stamps equals the order of the
        FIRST BYTE AFTER THE SECONDS.

        WHY THE RULE IS STATED AT THAT BYTE AND CONDITIONED ON AN EQUAL
        PREFIX. A string compare walks left to right, so the datetime
        prefix decides first and the suffix byte is reached only when each
        byte before it agrees. An earlier form of this record said an
        offset form sorts as OLDER, without that condition, and it came
        from a probe that compared ONE CHARACTER and no pair of stamps at
        all. A single-byte fact cannot carry a claim about a whole-string
        compare.

        A missing suffix takes the key -1, because a shorter string that is
        a prefix of a longer one sorts first.

        🔴 THE PRECONDITION, AND THE RULE IS INCORRECT OUTSIDE IT: THE
        DATETIME PREFIX MUST BE FIXED-WIDTH AND THE SECONDS MUST BE PRESENT.
        MEASURED, two forms that break it, and neither is chased into the
        fixture above because adding them is the enumeration returning by
        another route:
          - `2026-08-19 20:00:00+00:00` decides at INDEX 10, a SPACE at 0x20
            against `T` at 0x54, which is nine bytes before the position this
            rule names. `str(datetime.now(timezone.utc))` produces it.
          - `2026-08-19T20:00:00.123Z` against `2026-08-19T20:00:00.123456Z`
            carries `.` as the byte after the seconds for BOTH, so the rule
            answers NOTHING. The compare decides at INDEX 23, and the LATER
            instant reads as older. Two ordinary calls in one codebase make
            that pair.
        A `timespec='minutes'` form has no seconds field, so the named
        position does not exist at all.

        THE BOUND: that list comes from a probe of the stdlib producers and
        one hand-built form. A producer outside those is outside the check,
        and NO RULE ABOUT WHICH BYTE DECIDES CAN BE MADE COMPLETE, because a
        new spelling can move the deciding byte somewhere no rule anticipated.
