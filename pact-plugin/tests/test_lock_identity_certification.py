"""Certification of the lock-identity fix: the sidecar names what the write binds.

WHAT IS UNDER CERTIFICATION. `file_lock` keys its sidecar on

    target_file.parent.resolve() / f".{target_file.name}.lock"

in both twins (`hooks/shared/claude_md_manager.py`,
`skills/pact-memory/scripts/working_memory.py`). The PARENT is resolved so two
SPELLINGS of one directory produce one sidecar; the LEAF is deliberately NOT
resolved, because the write is `os.replace` — renameat(2) — which binds the
final component as a directory ENTRY without following it.

The superseded formula resolved the WHOLE target. Under a leaf symlink that
named a different directory than the write, and — because the write REPLACES
the leaf entry — the sidecar computed for one target path CHANGED ACROSS THE
WRITE. A mutual-exclusion primitive whose identity is a function of the state
it protects does not serialise that state. That is the defect closed here.

CERTIFICATION IS BIDIRECTIONAL. It is not enough to show the lock and write
agree; the property that IS real must be preserved:
  (a) lock and write cannot name different directories under a leaf symlink,
      and the sidecar is STABLE across the write;
  (b) two SPELLINGS of one directory still take ONE lock.

DELIBERATELY NOT CERTIFIED — two NAMES for one INODE (leaf symlink, hardlink)
do NOT collapse onto one sidecar, and no longer should. That property was
retired on purpose: a rename-based write destroys the alias relationship on
the first commit, so it protected a relationship that no longer exists. The
old formula never delivered it in general anyway — a hardlink pair is exactly
two names for one inode and never collapsed, because `resolve()` canonicalises
symlinks, not inodes. A test pinning it would certify a reversed decision.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TWO MEASURED FACTS ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS, recorded because both invert the
intuitive choice and a later reader will otherwise "harden" them backwards.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. PROVENANCE MUST USE `__module__`, NOT `inspect.getsourcefile()`.
   `file_lock` is `@contextmanager`-decorated, so what callers import is a
   wrapper. It would be natural to assume `__module__` reports the decorator
   and to reach for `getsourcefile()` as the more rigorous check. MEASURED,
   and it is the reverse:

     `__module__`            canonical 'shared.claude_md_manager'
                             skill     'scripts.working_memory' -> DISCRIMINATES
     `inspect.getsourcefile` canonical contextlib.py
                             skill     contextlib.py             -> DOES NOT

   `functools.wraps` copies `__module__` through the decorator, so it is
   accurate. `getsourcefile()` resolves the wrapper's code object to
   contextlib.py for BOTH twins, while `_atomic_write_text` (undecorated)
   resolves to its real module — so a same-module guard built on it ABORTS on
   every LEGITIMATE pairing and "catches" the cross-module ones only by
   accident of that mismatch. It fails in both directions. Do not swap it in.

2. THE T-1 PARAGRAPH'S END ANCHOR IS NOT LOAD-BEARING. Including or excluding
   the trailing blank line yields the same sha256, because the extraction is
   rstripped. The START anchor and the token are what carry the extraction. A
   reader who later "tightens" the end anchor should know it was never doing
   work.

# obligation is traceable to a docstring, and an obligation named in a banner
# but claimed by nothing reads as a gap.
#
# L8 asks that the failure-log site is unchanged in behaviour. It is covered BY
# INHERITANCE: that site carries its OWN leaf `is_symlink()` guard inside the
# lock and pre-creates its parent before taking it, so on the only topology
# where the two formulas differ -- a symlinked leaf -- the write is refused
# under BOTH, and the site can create no directory either way. Its existing
# tests pass untouched.
#
# STATE THE STRENGTH HONESTLY: that is weaker than L1-L4, which are certified
# directly here. Inheritance is an argument that the site cannot be affected,
# not a measurement that it was not. If the failure-log site ever loses its own
# leaf guard or stops pre-creating its parent, this obligation silently becomes
# uncovered and nothing in this file will notice.
