"""One expression yields the store file path, and each consumer reaches it.

WHAT THIS FILE PINS, and why the sibling witness suite does not cover it.
`test_memory_store_isolation.py` proves the store resolves AWAY from the
operator's real store under test. It says nothing about a caller that names its
own store, and that was the open hole: the tree held THREE expressions that
derived the store file, and they disagreed inside a single invocation.

  1. `config.compute_db_path` composed the file name.
  2. `database.get_db_path` composed it a second time.
  3. `database.get_connection` had a third rule, `db_path or get_db_path()`,
     which made the caller path a RIVAL of the resolver rather than an input.

With `--db-path /tmp/x.db`, rule 3 opened `/tmp/x.db` while every layer that
asked the resolver got `<default>/memory.db`. The connection and the resolver
named different files in one command. Two of the three derivations are gone,
and a `ContextVar` store scope carries the caller path THROUGH the survivor.

WHICH ARMS CAN GO RED, stated because an arm that cannot fail retires the
question it appears to answer:

  RED ON THE UNPATCHED TREE, by behaviour a reader can reproduce:
    - the scoped search arm, the scoped status arm, the three setup arms,
      the two single-derivation arms, the guard-order arm.
  RED AGAINST A MUTANT ONLY, and each such arm names its mutant in its own
  docstring:
    - the inheritance arms (the unconditional `set()` spelling),
    - the connection-factory arm (a added `isolation_level`),
    - the refusal arm (a `raise` added to the resolver).
  NON-REGRESSION, green before and after, and LABELLED AS SUCH in place:
    - the default-resolution arm and the creates-nothing arm.

WHAT OUTRANKS EVERYTHING HERE. The scope is a REDIRECT and never a REFUSAL.
`archive_pin --index N` is a production command that passes no path on purpose
and must reach the real store. An isolation that works by making the default
unreachable would refuse an honest user command, so those arms rank above the
isolation arms and `TestTheScopeIsARedirectAndNotARefusal` carries them.
