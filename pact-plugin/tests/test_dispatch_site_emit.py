"""dispatch_site — the hook-side emit that carries the coverage DENOMINATOR.

One event per dispatched Task-B, emitted at the owner-WITNESSING TaskUpdate —
any write naming a pact-specialist `owner` on a non-teachback, non-exempt
task. The event's EXISTENCE is a dispatch site; the OPTIONAL `variety` within
it is the numerator. Both terms come from one stream, which is what makes
coverage > 1.0 structurally impossible rather than merely guarded.

MEMBERSHIP IS OWNER-WITNESSED, NEVER INFERRED. Live dispatch practice wires
owners in SPLIT writes (owner in one update, blockers at creation or in
another), so the population leg is the owner-BEARING shape, not the composite
owner+addBlockedBy the ordering gate keys on — a composite-keyed population is
dark by construction on every real arc. Teachback Task-A gates are excluded by
the SUBJECT carve-out alone (the named dependence: an owner-only write is
exactly the split wiring a gate receives); review-panel dispatches are EXCLUDED
because no owner write ever witnesses them (documented exclusion — their
dispatches stay visible via the review_dispatch stream).

WHY THE TaskUpdate BRANCH AND NOT BESIDE dispatch_variety: that emit lives in
the TaskCreate branch and keys on metadata.variety PRESENCE, because
TaskCreate(B) leaves owner empty — an owner-wiring predicate placed there would
return False forever and Q5 would stay dark with every test still green. These
tests pin the emit to the branch where an owner-bearing write is observable.

Each step of the evaluation order gets a negation test, because every one of
them fails SILENTLY: a wrong frame gate zeroes the population, a dropped
team_name precondition craters coverage while the number still renders, and a
missing dedup claim turns one dispatch into two sites. None of those produce an
exception or a red anywhere else.

Drives tlg.evaluate_lifecycle against a real on-disk team config, task store
and O_EXCL marker root, with tlg.append_event spied to capture events — EXCEPT
the seam-integration class at the bottom, which leaves the journal write real.

            emits TWICE.
          * ``dispatch_site`` records a POSITION — one Task-B is one site, and
            the site IS the coverage denominator. A re-wired Task-B is the
            same position, so a second event FABRICATES a denominator entry.

        One counts occurrences, the other counts positions. Neither is a
        mistake, and **aligning them "for consistency" is the defect** — it
        does not take carelessness, only a maintainer who reads the pinned
        sibling and tidies this family to match.

        THE COST OF GETTING IT WRONG IS SILENT AND IN THE HARMFUL DIRECTION:
        the fabricated second site carries no variety, so a correctly-stamped
        dispatch reports 1 of 2 = 0.500 where the truth is 1 of 1 = 1.000 —
        a compliance gap invented out of a re-wire. Measured: an
        owner-dependent key applied to the claim and its unclaim twin passes
        the entire suite without this pin.

        Paired with the eligibility control directly below — read them
        together, because this assertion alone cannot tell you WHY there is
        one event."""
