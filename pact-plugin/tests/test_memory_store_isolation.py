"""The memory store must never resolve to the operator's real store under test.

WHAT THESE TESTS ARE FOR, because a passing suite is not evidence here. The
suite passed with the leak wide open: 13,812 tests green while 60 of them
opened write-capable connections to the live store. So "the tests pass" cannot
distinguish an isolated system from a leaking one, and every assertion below is
written to FAIL on the pre-fix code rather than to describe the post-fix code.

THE TWO MECHANISMS THAT LEAKED, each with a test here:
  1. IMPORT-TIME BINDING. `config` computed its paths from `Path.home()` when
     the module first imported, so a later redirect reached a value that no
     longer existed to change. Protection depended on import ORDER.
  2. THE PROCESS BOUNDARY. An in-process patch does not survive `exec`, so a
     spawned CLI child resolved the real home however carefully the parent had
     been redirected.

WHAT MUST KEEP WORKING, and it outranks the isolation. Production entry points
that pass no path SHOULD reach the real store: that is what `archive_pin
--index N` does, and `/PACT:prune-memory` keys its refuse-or-proceed decision
on it. A fix that isolates tests by making the default unreachable would refuse
an honest user command, which damages real work rather than merely risking it.
`TestProductionStillResolvesTheRealStore` is that guarantee.

    RESOLVED AT COLLECTION FOR TWO SEPARATE REASONS, both measured.

    1. NOT VIA `import conftest`. That statement builds a SECOND module object
       under its own `sys.modules` key and RE-EXECUTES the module body, which
       calls `tempfile.mkdtemp` again. The value it reports is a directory no
       test ever used, so an equality check against it can never pass -- and it
       would fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the layer under test.
       It also leaks an empty directory on every call.
    2. AT COLLECTION, FOR TWO STRUCTURAL REASONS. The per-test fixture overwrites
       this variable before any test body runs, so collection is the last moment
       the session layer's value is readable at all (see `_STORE_AT_COLLECTION`).
       And this helper cannot use `_loaded_conftest` below even if it wanted to:
       `request` is a fixture, so it does not exist at module import, which is
       why the path scan survives beside the deterministic lookup.

       An earlier version of this note justified collection time by the absence
       of a duplicate module, which a re-import in
       `TestTheConftestLiteralMatchesItsSource` used to create. That re-import is
       gone and the justification went with it: collection excludes a duplicate
       made by a test BODY, but not one made at another module's IMPORT time by a
       module collected earlier. No module does that today, which is contingent
       rather than structural. The `len(found) != 1` check below is the detector
