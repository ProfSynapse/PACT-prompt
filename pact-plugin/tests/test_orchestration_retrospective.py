Tests for orchestration retrospective in wrap-up.md.

Tests cover:
1. Orchestration Retrospective section exists
2. Four assessment questions defined
3. pact-memory save convention documented
4. Estimation pattern question documented
5. Q5/Q6 journal-read hardening
6. Q5/Q6 extractions are total (no direct-indexing comprehension)
7. Q5's recovery path depends on the dimension-sum resolver candidate

# THE EXTRACTION RUNNERS: ONE FOR EACH QUESTION, AND ONE FOR EACH Q5 PATH.
#
# THE DEFECT THAT PRODUCED THIS SPLIT, recorded so nobody re-merges them. A
# SINGLE runner took `snapshot_events` with a default of EMPTY. An empty
# snapshot stream sends each member of the Q5 join to the FALLBACK, where the
# join does not read the snapshot side at all. So a caller that omitted the
# argument selected a path it did not choose, and the choice was invisible at
# the call site. Measured: this file detected 1 mutant of 15 in a sweep of the
# join helper. The mutants that inverted the value precedence, narrowed the
# resolver on the snapshot side, and widened membership from the snapshot
# stream were ALL invisible to it.
#
# WHAT THE SPLIT MAKES STRUCTURALLY IMPOSSIBLE, in mechanism and not in an
# assertion. Each item below is enforced by a signature or by a namespace, so
# no reviewer vigilance is necessary.
#
#   1. A Q5 caller CANNOT take the fallback path in silence. The two paths are
#      different functions and the path is readable from the NAME, without a
#      reader inspecting the argument.
#   2. A Q5 caller CANNOT call the joined runner and receive the fallback. The
#      joined runner REFUSES an empty snapshot list, and it raises.
#   3. A Q6 caller CANNOT pass a snapshot value, and a Q6 expression CANNOT
#      read one. The Q6 runner has no such parameter and puts no
#      `snapshot_events` name in its namespace, so a Q6 expression that ever
#      reaches for one raises NameError rather than read a silent empty list.
#
# WHAT THE SPLIT DOES NOT MAKE IMPOSSIBLE, stated because an aspirational
# claim here would repeat the defect. A file in which EVERY Q5 arm calls the
# fallback runner STAYS blind to each snapshot-side mutant. No signature
# can prevent that. A mutation sweep detects it, and a signature does not.
#
# THE THIRD STREAM, AND WHY IT IS NOT A PATH SELECTOR. The documented Q5
# expression names `dispatch_assessed` (the arc-scoped dispatch-marked
# variety_assessed events, the join's arm-2b source), so both Q5 runners
# put that name in the namespace. An EMPTY default for it does NOT select
# a path the caller did not choose — unlike an empty `snapshot_events`,
# which sends every member to the fallback — because arm 2b only rescues
# members no other stream resolved; with it empty, arm-1 and arm-2
# outcomes are byte-identical. An arm that tests arm 2b through the
# documented expression passes the stream explicitly, so the call site
# states what it exercises, same discipline as the runner names.
