"""The encoder receives an explicit token window, and the window is not small.

THE DEFECT THESE ARMS CLOSE. The encode call passed no `max_length`, so the
encoder applied its own default of 512 tokens. The measured median record in
the store runs to 1992 tokens, so a median record reached the semantic index at
roughly its first quarter and nothing reported the loss. `max_length` had ZERO
test hits in the memory layer, so no arm anywhere asserted that the call passed
a window at all.

NO ARM HERE WRITES A NUMBER. Each one imports the constant it compares against,
so the value lives in one place. A number written in two places goes stale in
one of them and nothing announces it.

NO ARM HERE RE-EMBEDS A RECORD, and that bound is deliberate. The vector write
path cannot replace a vector that is already stored, so a second write for one
memory raises. These arms assert at the CALL BOUNDARY, which needs no store and
no second write.

WHY THERE IS NO CHARACTER-SLICE ARM. The truncation has two arms in sequence. A
CHARACTER pre-slice keeps `max_length * model.median_token_length` characters,
then a TOKEN cut keeps `max_length` tokens. For text of density d characters
per token, `max_length` tokens occupy `max_length * d` characters, so the
pre-slice binds first only when d is above the multiplier. THE WINDOW CANCELS
OUT of that comparison. Measured across all 1819 records: minimum density
3.021, median 3.864, maximum 5.189. The multiplier for the configured model
measures 6. The maximum density sits below it, so the TOKEN cut binds for every
record and a character-slice arm would drive a branch nothing reaches.
THE ARGUMENT IS MODEL-SPECIFIC, not model-independent: the multiplier is a
property of the model rather than a constant of the library.
