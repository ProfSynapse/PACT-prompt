"""The two write-side splice windows are bound to the MEMORY region.

SIBLING OF `test_pin_marker_writer.py`, and it borrows that module's
production-derived builders rather than spell a boundary of its own.

WHAT THIS GUARDS. `extract_managed_region` returns the WIDE managed region.
The session block sits IN that region and ABOVE the memory marker pair, and
it interpolates caller-influenced values. The two write-side parsers search
their heading FIRST-MATCH in the window they get, and the offset of that
match rebuilds the file. So a forged `## Working Memory` line in the session
block takes the splice ABOVE the memory region, and the write lands outside
the part of the document the memory layer owns.

WHY THE ARMS ARE HERE AND NOT BESIDE THE SOURCE. The source is the work of
another seat. These arms are written from the DOCUMENT SHAPE rather than
from a read of that implementation, so they say what the writer must DO and
not how it is built.

THE RULE EACH ASSERTION BELOW OBEYS: IT MUST PASS AGAINST A DIFFERENT
CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION AND GO RED AGAINST THE WIDENING. So nothing here
asserts that a narrowing helper was called, what it returns, or the offsets
234, 274, 277, 304 and 377 that the author measured. Each of those is a fact
about one implementation, and each reddens on a clean refactor that keeps
the behaviour, which is a cost on a later author rather than a guard.

THE ORACLE IS INDEPENDENT OF THE MODULE UNDER TEST. The marker literals come
from `shared.claude_md_manager`, which is the canonical copy in the hooks
tree. A test that located the region with the constants of the module it
guards would agree with that module about the region by construction.

EACH ABSENCE ASSERTION HAS A POSITIVE PARTNER. Measured on this branch: an
absence assertion passed against leaking code, because an upstream
truncation removed the evidence rather than the defect. So where a test
below says the splice is NOT above the region, it also says where the splice
IS.

    THE TRIGGER IS THE CODE AND NOT A RULING, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS NOT
    PEDANTIC. An earlier version of this docstring said to re-point WHEN THE
    RULING LANDS. THE RULING HAS LANDED AND THE IMPLEMENTATION HAS NOT, so

    reader who obeys it re-points a correct arm at a behaviour the writer
    does not have. A test instruction keyed on a DECISION goes stale at the

    is the thing the arm measures.

      1. `_narrow_to_memory_region` returns None when the memory marker pair

    While the two hold, the write goes ahead and this arm is correct. When
