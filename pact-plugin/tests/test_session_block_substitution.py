"""The session block reaches CLAUDE.md literally, not through an escape grammar.

WHY THESE ARMS SIT AT `update_session_info` AND NOT AT A PURE FUNCTION.
The defect these arms hold is not in the pattern, not in the sanitize, and not
in the block assembly. Each of those is correct on its own. It exists ONLY in
the COMPOSED CALL, where an assembled block built from caller-influenced values
reached the replacement-STRING position of `re.sub`, and `re.sub` expands its
replacement grammar in a string. An arm at a pure-function surface cannot see a
defect that is a property of the composition.

THE SANITIZE DOES NOT COVER THIS, WHICH IS WHY THE ARMS LOOK REDUNDANT AND ARE
NOT. `_PROMPT_CONTROL_CHARS_RE` strips control characters, and a BACKSLASH is
not a control character. So the guard removes a newline and a string
replacement PUTS ONE BACK. Two carriers reach this call with no attacker,
because a directory name can legally contain a backslash.

THE ONE ARM THAT CARRIES THE ROW IS THE INVALID ESCAPE, AND IT IS NOT ABOUT A
CRASH. A `\\d` in the value raises `re.PatternError` inside the substitution,
and the `except Exception` in the same function catches it and returns a
FAILURE STRING. Nothing crashes. That is what made it survivable and permanent:
each later pass fails identically, so the block FREEZES at first-pass content
while the directory name persists, and state recovery then reads a stale
pointer. AN ARM THAT ASSERTS ONLY THAT NO EXCEPTION ESCAPED IS GREEN ON THE
PRE-FIX CODE FOR THE OTHER TWO PRODUCTIONS AS WELL, so it is worth nothing.
The assertion that separates the two states is a PAIR: the return value is the
update message, AND the block on disk carries the SECOND pass values.

THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS LOAD-BEARING. Each of the three negative arms is
satisfied by a substitution that stopped running. The control asserts an
ordinary path still writes its line, so a mechanism made inert reddens here
rather than passing three absence checks.

EVERY FIXTURE WRITES BELOW `tmp_path`. This suite must not reach a real
CLAUDE.md: the file is gitignored, always loaded, and has no commit behind it.

THE AXIS THESE ARMS CANNOT SEE, NAMED RATHER THAN LEFT IMPLICIT. They drive
Case 1, the marker-replacement path. Case 0 (file absent) and Case 2 (no
SESSION markers) build their content by f-string and `str.replace`, which have
no replacement grammar, so no production of this family reaches them. A future
edit that routes Case 2 through `re.sub` would be outside this file.
