"""
Executable tripwires over the Q5 EXEMPTION POLICY.

The denominator is now hook-emitted and therefore author-proof: no command
file can move it by writing prose. What CAN still move it is the exemption
sets — they decide which dispatches are sites at all. This file converts the
prose rules guarding them into assertions that can fail.

Each pin below names, in its own docstring, the MUTATION that reddens it. A
pin whose mutation cannot be named is not a pin; it is coverage-shaped
decoration, and this file exists because that failure has already shipped
twice in this area.

NOT PINNED FOR THE DENOMINATOR — the auditor's `metadata.type` state. The
denominator keys on `is_teachback_exempt`, which has no metadata surface, so
that fact is irrelevant to it. It IS pinned lower down for a different
consumer: the harvest propagation rule keeps the Working Memory block away
from an auditor that has not reported, which is only meaningful while auditors
stay non-exempt, which depends on that dispatch carrying no `type`.

    MUTATION THAT REDDENS: in `shared/intentional_wait.py`, replace the
    `TEACHBACK_EXEMPT_AGENT_TYPES = frozenset({...})` literal with
    `TEACHBACK_EXEMPT_AGENT_TYPES = SELF_COMPLETE_EXEMPT_AGENT_TYPES`.

    WHY IDENTITY AND NOT CONTENTS. The two frozensets hold identical
    contents today, so a content-shaped pin (`T == S`, or comparing either
    against a literal) stays GREEN on an aliased pair and detects nothing.
    `is not` is the only form that separates "two sets that happen to
    match" from "one set under two names".

    AND WHY NOT A PIN ON THE CONTENTS BEING EQUAL TODAY. That would redden
    on a change the module explicitly invites -- its docstring supports
    future divergence, a rote-only agentType joining one set with a one-line
    change. A test that fires on an intended edit is worse than no test, so
    the content relationship is recorded in this paragraph and asserted
    nowhere. A previous test did assert it, by binding a local alias and
    comparing that local against the constant it had just been assigned
    from; both arms were true by the assignment and no change to this module
    could redden either. Do not re-add that shape.

        Both were reproduced; the second passed before this widening.

        SCOPED TO AUDITOR DISPATCH BLOCKS, not to every metadata literal in
        the tree. A blocker or algedonic dispatch MUST carry `metadata.type` --
        `is_self_complete_exempt` requires it -- so a file-wide ban would redden
        on correct future work. A `type` key on some other dispatch's metadata
        is out of scope BY DESIGN: it is not this dispatch's metadata.

        THE ASSOCIATION UNIT IS THE BLOCK, NOT THE LINE. A line-scoped scan sees
        only a literal sharing a line with `auditor`, so a multiline
        `TaskCreate(...)` -- the house style for substantial dispatch blocks in
        these very files -- is invisible to it, and the arm stays GREEN on a
        dispatch that would make `is_self_complete_exempt` treat the auditor as
        exempt. That was live, not hypothetical: a probe carrying `type` passed
        green before this change.

        LATENT, and structural rather than absent: a markdown table has no blank
        lines, so an entire table is one block. A row mentioning an auditor and a
        different row carrying a legitimate `type` would be associated by this
        unit and redden correct work. Measured zero in commands/ today, and the
        shape exists in this repo's markdown elsewhere. Two dispatches sharing
        one block is the same hazard by another route. If either appears, the
        unit must tighten to the enclosing call rather than the block.

        Sites are globbed rather than listed, so a third dispatch file is
        scanned without anyone remembering to add it, and the assertion below is
        a FLOOR rather than an inventory -- growth is silent. DELIBERATE LOSS,
        recorded rather than left to be discovered later: this arm can no longer
        report that the scanned population changed. An "unexpected site" signal
        would reintroduce the redden-on-correct-work direction in a softer form.

        THE FLOOR ALSO GUARDS THE DIRECTORY, and that is emergent rather than
        designed, so it is easy to destroy by accident. Repointing COMMANDS_DIR
        at agents/ makes both named files vanish and the floor fires -- measured,
        and it is the ONLY thing catching that route, because
        `q.parent == COMMANDS_DIR` is true by construction for anything
        `COMMANDS_DIR.glob()` yields and so cannot see a repointing. Do not
        "simplify" this to a bare non-empty check: the directory protection goes
        with it, and agents/ and protocols/ carry legitimate `type`-bearing
        literals that would come into range all at once.

        Keys are read by `_metadata_keys` rather than parsed, which IS
        prospective -- both literals in the tree today are valid JSON.
