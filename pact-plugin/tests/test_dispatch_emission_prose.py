"""Structural pin tests for the per-dispatch `variety_assessed` emission sites.

Every dispatch path that stamps `metadata.variety` on a Task B also writes a
`variety_assessed` journal event keyed on that task's id, carrying the four
dimension scores and the total, with the TOP-LEVEL `"scope": "dispatch"`
discriminator present. The FEATURE-level assessment event carries NO `scope`
field, and journal readers key on that difference (session_state first-event
feature derivation and variety_divergence arc_start exclude dispatch-marked
events; the wrap-up Q5 join consumes them as an as-dispatched fallback
source). A hand-written emission that omits the field degrades to
feature-level — the legacy behavior — so the discriminator's presence on
every per-dispatch site is load-bearing and pinned here at the block level.

THE SLICE RULE, stated beside the arms that use it: the guarded unit is a
fenced block that contains a `variety_assessed` journal write. A per-dispatch
block MUST carry the discriminator in its JSON body AND a trap label naming
its own file; a feature-level block MUST carry neither a discriminator NOR a
`scope` key at the top level of its JSON body. File-wide token counts would
let a discriminator sitting in some unrelated prose satisfy an arm, so every
assertion is block-scoped.

COUNTS ARE FLOORS AND THEY MOVE ONLY DELIBERATELY. The per-dispatch site
count per file reflects the dispatch shapes the file teaches: orchestrate
carries four (PREPARE/ARCHITECT/CODE/TEST), comPACT two (concurrent +
single), peer-review/plan-mode/rePACT one each. A repair that fixed one
site of a file would leave the others dark while a presence-only check
stayed green, so the floors are exact counts and refuse movement in either
direction.
