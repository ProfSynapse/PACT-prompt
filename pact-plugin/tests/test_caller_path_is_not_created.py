"""A caller-supplied store path is OPENED, never brought into existence.

THE HALF THIS CLOSES. An earlier refusal covered a typo in the DIRECTORY. A
typo in the FILE NAME reached a directory that was present, built a store, and
reported an ordinary result. In the true spelling that throwaway store lands
INSIDE the live store directory, so the caller keeps working against a store
that holds nothing.

THE REFUSAL LIVES AT THE CLI BOUNDARY, IN `cli.main`, AND THESE ARMS DRIVE THE
CLI. A refusal inside `database.get_connection` was built first and rejected:
it reaches EACH caller of the connection factory, so it breaks the custom-store
contract that production and the test suite depend on. The boundary can read
the command name as a fact on `args`, so it separates `setup` from the commands
that open a store.

THE ASYMMETRY IS DELIBERATE. `setup` creates, because bringing a store into
existence at a named location is its operation. `save`, `get` and `list` open a
store that should be there, so an absent one is a typo.

THE CLASS OF EACH ARM, BECAUSE RED HAS SEVERAL CAUSES AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS
THE MECHANISM.

  RED FOR THE MECHANISM on the unfixed code:
    test_an_absent_caller_file_is_refused. The store was built and the caller
    saw an ordinary result.

  OVER-BLOCK GUARDS. These cannot go red on the unfixed code, because it
  carries no refusal to over-block. They bound the refusal instead:
    test_a_store_that_is_present_still_opens
    test_a_path_holding_shell_or_uri_syntax_still_opens
    test_setup_may_bring_a_caller_path_into_existence

  GREEN BEFORE AND AFTER, AND IT OUTRANKS THE REFUSAL:
    test_the_derived_route_still_creates. An arm proving only the refusal would
    pass against a fix that broke each production caller.

  PINS AN ACCEPTED TRADE RATHER THAN A DESIRED OUTCOME:
    test_an_absent_path_is_reported_before_malformed_input. Read its docstring

    Six sibling error sites in `cli.py` scrub before they report, because a
    caller pipes this envelope into a log and an absolute path carries the
    account name. The refusal is the seventh site and follows the same idiom.

    THIS ARM EXISTS BECAUSE THE PROPERTY WAS CORRECT AND UNDEFENDED. Removal
    of the `_scrub` call left the suite green, which is the same shape as the
    defect this file closes: a property that holds today and that no arm
    watches tomorrow. A guard nobody watches is one edit from gone.

    MUTANT THAT KILLS THIS ARM: report `str(db_path)` in place of the scrubbed
    value at the refusal site in `cli.main`.
