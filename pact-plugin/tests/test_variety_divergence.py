"""
GC-immune regression suite for the wrap-up Q5 coverage denominator + the
coverage-exceeds-unity tripwire (epic #972, children #971/#963).

This file is the dedicated home for the pure helpers in
shared/variety_divergence.py that back the §4 Orchestration Retrospective
Q5 (variety divergence):

  - extract_dispatch_coverage(dispatch_site_events) — derives BOTH Q5 terms
    from ONE pass over ONE list. The DENOMINATOR is the existence of each
    `dispatch_site` event; the NUMERATOR is the resolvable stamps within
    those same events. Because every element of `variety_totals` comes from
    an event that also incremented `total`, coverage > 1.0 is structurally
    impossible rather than merely unobserved.

  - the coverage_exceeds_unity early-return in compute_variety_divergence —
    a non-clamping advisory tripwire: when stamped > total it returns
    reason="coverage_exceeds_unity", surfaced=False, coverage left UNCLAMPED.
    It is now UNREACHABLE from the Q5 path (see above) and is retained only
    as defense-in-depth for a caller that assembles the two terms by hand.

The predecessor denominator — a 3-argument helper counting
agent_dispatch + review_dispatch.reviewers + deduped remediation — was
RETIRED when the denominator moved to the one-event topology. Its tests are
deleted rather than ported: they encoded 3-marker dedup semantics that have
no referent here, and porting them would have manufactured meaning. The
properties that survive the change of subject are re-expressed below and in
test_session_journal.py (arc-scoping), NOT dropped.

Non-vacuity: extract_dispatch_coverage is a NET-NEW symbol, so a source-only
revert removes it entirely (ImportError / collection error, not a clean
assertion fail). The behavioural guards that DO fail cleanly are the
absent-vs-malformed partition and the structural `stamped <= total` bound,
both asserted over arbitrary input below.

GC-immune: every fixture is a synthetic journal event built via
session_journal.make_event — zero dependence on the GC-reaped task store.

    THIRD: a `ts` that PARSES and does NOT COMPARE.

    THE MECHANISM. `_parse_ts` is
    `datetime.fromisoformat(str(value).replace("Z", "+00:00"))`. A `ts` with
    NO timezone designator has no `Z` to replace, so it parses and returns a
    NAIVE datetime. The try block in the picker wraps the parse AND the
    compare, so `parsed >= current[0]` on a naive-against-aware pair raises
    TypeError and the event is skipped. THAT EVENT HAS A PARSED INSTANT AND
    NO COMPARABLE ONE, which is why the stated limit is about ORDER and not
    about instants.

    WHY THESE ARMS ARE HERE. The F4 stated limit in the helper docstring
    RESTS ON that parser property, and no arm pinned it. If a later edit
    makes `_parse_ts` attach UTC to a bare value, the third cause disappears
    and the shipped ground goes stale with nothing red.

    THE BOUND, SO A READER DOES NOT TAKE `THIS CAN HAPPEN` AS `THIS
    HAPPENS`. The path is reachable BY CONSTRUCTION of the parser. NO naive
    `ts` was found in a live journal, so THESE ARMS MAKE NO FIELD CLAIM.
    They pin that the path EXISTS and not that it occurs. A field claim is a
    journal census and a different question.
