"""The session-end marker survives a forged section heading above it.

WHAT THIS GUARDS. The section-end scanners search their heading FIRST-MATCH in
the window they are given. When the memory marker pair is missing, that window
falls back to the WIDE managed region, and the session block sits in it. A
forged section heading in the session block then wins the search, and the body
scan runs from that heading. If the scan does not stop at `<!-- SESSION_END -->`
the rebuild replaces the span that holds it, and the marker is GONE from the
emitted document. `CLAUDE.md` is not a tracked file here, so no commit restores
it.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. The source repair shipped with its author
recording that a green suite proved nothing about it, and that the evidence
lived in a probe the author deleted. This file is that evidence, made
permanent.

=====================================================================
THE SEPARATION MATRIX, MEASURED, AND IT DECIDES THE ARM COUNT
=====================================================================

The repair touches FOUR regex sites: a LOOKAHEAD site and a TERMINATOR site in
each of the two section parsers. Each site was reverted INDEPENDENTLY, scoped
by the ast line range of its function, against four candidate fixtures. `X`
marks a document that lost its session-end marker.

    reverted site        WM-look  WM-term  RC-look  RC-term
    WM lookahead            X        .        .        .
    WM terminator           X        X        .        .
    RC lookahead            .        .        X        .
    RC terminator           .        .        X        X

READ IT BY COLUMN. The WM-look fixture catches the two WORKING MEMORY reverts
and NO Retrieved Context revert. The RC-look fixture catches the two RETRIEVED
CONTEXT reverts and no Working Memory revert. The two terminator fixtures each
catch a strict subset of what their own lookahead fixture catches, so they add
no kill.

SO THE MINIMAL SUFFICIENT SET IS TWO ARMS, AND THE AXIS IS THE SECTION AND NOT
THE HALF. Each arm below is NECESSARY: neither one catches a single revert in
the other section. A terminator-shape arm is not necessary, because the
lookahead shape reaches both halves of its own section.

THE LOOKAHEAD SHAPE REACHES BOTH HALVES FOR ONE CAUSE. With the heading on the
line above the marker, the marker is the candidate the optional auto-managed
comment group would consume, AND it is the first boundary the body scan meets.
Either site alone is enough to swallow it, so the fixture that puts it in both
positions catches either revert.

=====================================================================
THE FIXTURE RULES, AND EACH ONE ANSWERS A MEASURED FAILURE
=====================================================================

1. THE BOUNDARY COMES FROM THE PRODUCTION EMITTER, through `build_claude_md`
   and `production_head_and_tail`, and never from a literal here. A
   hand-written boundary agrees with every other hand-written boundary and
   with nothing that ships.

2. THE FORGED HEADING TEXT APPEARS TWICE. With one heading the defect run and
   a correct run emit the same document, so the run separates nothing. The
   count is PRINTED beside each arm, so the control is visible rather than
   asserted.

3. THE MEMORY MARKER PAIR IS ABSENT. Measured: with the pair PRESENT the
   window bound keeps the write inside the memory region and the marker
   survives every one of the four reverts. The erasure needs the pair-absent
   fallback, so an arm built on a pair-present document is green against the
   defect it is named for.
