"""The memory-entry heading the writers emit, against the gate rule that reads it.

WHY THIS FILE SITS WITH THE WRITERS AND NOT WITH THE GATE. The failure guarded
here is a WRITER change that invalidates a precondition the GATE depends on.
The person who makes that change is editing `working_memory.py` and has no
reason to open the tests of `pin_staleness_gate.py`. An arm parked beside the
gate is invisible to the one person able to break it.

WHAT THE GATE DOES WITH THE HEADING. `pin_staleness_gate.py` excludes an entry
from the pin count when its heading is DATE-LED and it carries no
`<!-- pinned: -->` marker. That exclusion is what stops memory entries counting
as pins. If it stops accepting the emitted heading, the count rises, the gate
fires, and a faithful edit to the Pinned Context section is DENIED.

THE ARM HOLDS A RELATION, NOT A FORMAT, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
A format pin makes a claim about ONE party: the writer. The property worth
holding is an AGREEMENT between two parties that live in different files. A
one-sided pin reddens when the WRITER moves and stays GREEN when the GATE
moves, so tightening the gate pattern breaks the pair with a passing arm over
it. That direction is worse than an abandoned arm, because the gate continues
to depend on the format and now disagrees with it, so nothing looks abandoned
and nothing reports.

SO THE VALUE COMES FROM THE WRITER AND THE PREDICATE COMES FROM THE GATE.
The arm calls the writer, takes the heading it ACTUALLY emits, imports
`_DATE_LED_HEADING_RE`, and asserts the pattern accepts that heading. THIS IS
NOT THE PATTERN TESTED AGAINST ITSELF: nothing here copies the pattern in as an
expected value, and the two sides come from two files. It reddens when either
end moves.

WHY NOT DESCRIBE THE SHAPE IN THIS FILE INSTEAD. The heading carries a
timestamp built at call time, so an arm cannot assert a literal and must
DESCRIBE the shape. That description becomes a THIRD spelling of the date
shape, beside the writer format string and the gate pattern. Three spellings
that must agree is the generator of the drift this arm is here to catch.

        NON-DATE direction only. The exclusion cannot grow in that direction.
        IT CAN GROW IN THE DATE DIRECTION, and nothing bounded that. Peer
        review widened the trailing anchor of `_DATE_LED_HEADING_RE` so the

          1. QUIET. A true pin add titled with a date prefix stops counting as
             a pin, so the gate says nothing where it should speak. That is an
             under-block.

             from `### 2026-08-05 Draft notes` to `### Draft notes`, with no
             marker on either side. The widened pattern drops the OLD title
             from the count, the old count falls, the new count is then the
             greater, and the gate FIRES where the shipped tree stayed quiet.
             A faithful rename is DENIED.

        AND THE WIDENED POPULATION SITS OUTSIDE THE USER RULING. The ruling
        declares empty the population of a pin titled a BARE date with no
        marker. `### 2026-08-05 Draft notes` is not a bare date, so the ruling
        does not cover the class the widening opens, while the shipped

    `_DATE_LED_HEADING_RE` makes the hour-and-minute group OPTIONAL, so it
    accepts a date-only heading. NEITHER WRITER EMITS ONE: each builds its
    heading from a format that carries a date AND a time. So the optional
    branch has no producer in the shipped tree.

    WHY THAT IS WORTH RECORDING. It is the surface where drift can happen
    unobserved. A writer that later emits a date-only heading would be accepted
    with no arm reporting the change of shape. This class states the position
    rather than defends it.

    🔴 A CORRECTION TO THIS DOCSTRING, MEASURED BY PEER REVIEW. It said before
    that a later editor who removes the optional group "would break nothing
    that runs today". THAT IS INCORRECT AND ITS OWN FILE REFUTES IT. A mutant
    that makes the hour-and-minute group REQUIRED gives 2 failed and 19 passed
    against a control of 21 passed. One of the two failures is
    `test_the_pattern_accepts_a_date_only_heading`, which sits a few lines
    below this sentence in this class. The other is
    `test_r2_an_edit_that_adds_a_missing_marker_fires` in the gate file.

    AND THE OPTIONAL GROUP IS CORRECT AS SHIPPED, so this class records a
    position rather than a defect. The consumer alphabet is WIDER than the
    producer alphabet, because the gate reads a file a HUMAN also edits, and
    the two failure directions are not symmetric. KEEP the group, and a pin
    titled a bare date with no marker drops out of the count, which is an
    under-block on a population a user ruling declares empty. REMOVE the group,
    and a hand-written date-only entry counts as a PIN, the count rises, and a

    🔴 WHAT THE ACCEPTED SET IS NOT. It is NOT the set the writers can emit.
    MEASURED on the shipped pattern over this population: 6 accepted against 1
    emittable. The gate deliberately accepts five lines no writer produces, and
    each is a tolerance the pattern carries on purpose. So an arm asserting
    "accepted equals emittable" is RED on a correct tree, and the oracle has to
    name the tolerance rather than deny it.

    THE SHAPE THAT HOLDS, AND IT IS TWO-DIRECTIONAL BY CONSTRUCTION.
        accepted == emittable + DECLARED_TOLERANCE
    A WIDENING adds a member to the left and reddens. A NARROWING removes one
    and reddens. Neither direction needs an arm that names the node.

    THE BOUND, AND IT IS NOT A PROOF. This is BOUNDED-EXHAUSTIVE OVER A
    GENERATED POPULATION, not a proof about the language. The population is
    one-at-a-time from TWO baselines, the writer line and the same line with
    the time group absent, so it reaches ONE interaction and no other. AND THE
    ENUMERATION AGES: it is built from the pattern AS IT IS TODAY, so an edit
    that ADDS a node adds a dimension no list written today can hold. Do not
    read this class as coverage of the predicate for ever.

    THE SECOND BASELINE IS THERE BECAUSE THE FIRST ONE HID A POSITION, and the
    lesson generalises past this pattern. A dimension that renders LATE cannot
    reach a node that sits EARLY, because the line fails before the late text
    is read. So a population built from one baseline is blind to every node
    that the baseline's own earlier text already decides. WHEN YOU ADD A
