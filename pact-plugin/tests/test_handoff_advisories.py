"""The two HANDOFF schema advisories wired into task_lifecycle_gate:

  handoff_schema_invalid_at_completion — lead-side, at the completing write
  handoff_schema_invalid_at_write_time — author-side, at their own write

EVERY ARM HERE IS A POSITIVE CONTROL OR ITS PAIRED NEGATIVE. A schema advisory
that never fires is indistinguishable from a green suite, so each SILENT row
sits beside a FIRES row built from the same fixture.

Both advisories key on a handoff that is PRESENT. Nothing here fires on a
completion carrying no handoff at all: signal completions, session briefings
and other exempt work legitimately store none, and "may this owner complete
without a HANDOFF?" is a question this gate does not answer.
