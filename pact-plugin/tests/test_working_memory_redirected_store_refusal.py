Summary: DOCUMENT-PAIR arms for the refusal that stops a memory row written to a
         REDIRECTED store from being projected into an AMBIENTLY resolved
         CLAUDE.md. Each arm drives `cli.py` in a CHILD PROCESS and compares the
         document BEFORE against the document AFTER, because the guard's whole
         subject is a write that either happened or did not, and a single-line
         probe of the predicate cannot see a document at all.

         WHY A CHILD PROCESS IS THE ONLY WAY TO REACH THE GUARD. The guard
         exempts an in-process caller (`"pytest" in sys.modules`), because the
         suite binds a redirected store for every test AND syncs ambiently on
         purpose. So an in-process arm can never observe the refusal, and an
         in-process arm that appeared to would be measuring something else.

         WHY THE ENVIRONMENT IS BUILT AND NEVER INHERITED. The sibling guard
         `_refuse_ambient_target_under_pytest` raises the SAME exception type on
         the SAME path when `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` is present. An inherited
         environment carries that variable into the child, the sibling refuses
         first, and every arm below goes green while measuring the OTHER guard.
         Each arm therefore builds its own environment and asserts the variable
         is absent from it. That absence is the separating condition, and it is
         asserted rather than assumed.

         SAFETY, AND IT IS THE POINT OF THE WHOLE FILE. These arms drive a real
         `save`. If the guard did not hold, the write would land in a real
         CLAUDE.md. Two independent bindings keep the child below `tmp_path`:
         `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` with a SEEDED document (the resolver probes that
         directory and CONTINUES when it finds nothing, so seeding is what makes
         the probe terminate), and `HOME`, which puts the default store below
         `tmp_path` as well. Every arm then asserts containment.

        and that is what makes the admission correct rather than merely tolerable.
        A PACT worktree holds no CLAUDE.md of its own. Resolution therefore falls
        through to the MAIN checkout's file on purpose, and each ordinary worktree
        session depends on that fall-through to reach the file it displays. So for
        a default store, resolving outside the declared root IS the normal case,
        and a refusal here breaks the memory display for each such session. That
        is the cardinal over-block.

        A WEAKER CAUSE WAS RECORDED HERE BEFORE AND IS REPLACED, because a weak
        cause invites a later reader to overturn a correct decision. The weaker
        one: the row sits in the store the display reads from, so the entry can
        be looked up. That is correct, and it compares HARM SEVERITY. The cause
        above says the behaviour is the design, which is much harder to argue
        away.
