"""Tests for shared/handoff_schema.py — canonical handoff schema constants,
the required/recommended split, the legacy alias map, and both validators.

Pins:
  - HANDOFF_CANONICAL_FIELDS: the 6 names in template order
  - HANDOFF_REQUIRED_FIELDS: FIVE, derived by carving the recommended set out
    of the canonical set — never six, and never hard-coded
  - HANDOFF_LEGACY_ALIASES: exactly the three spellings the repo's own docs
    once taught; a fourth would be inference, not evidence
  - validate_handoff_schema: fires on a missing required key (naming a legacy
    alias when one is present) and stays SILENT on the three shapes the real
    handoff population is made of
  - resolve_handoff_field: canonical first, legacy alias only as fallback

THE SILENT ARMS ARE THE LOAD-BEARING ONES. A validator that fires on a
recommended-field absence, on an extra key, or on a legitimately empty value
would fire on most real handoffs, so each of those has an explicit arm here.
