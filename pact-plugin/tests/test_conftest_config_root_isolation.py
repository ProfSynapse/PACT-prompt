Summary: Positive regression pin for the autouse conftest fixture
         ``_isolate_config_root_to_tmp`` (PR #1189 / #1186). The fixture scrubs
         ``CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`` and redirects ``Path.home()`` -> ``tmp_path`` so
         every PACT state writer resolves under the per-test tmp, NEVER the
         operator's real ``~/.claude``. The real-writer suites
         (test_agent_handoff_marker, test_snapshot_marker_root_fallback, ...)
         prove the closure MECHANISM — but each SELF-PATCHES ``Path.home``, so
         they stay green even if the fixture were disabled: a future edit
         removing or breaking the fixture would reopen #1186 SILENTLY (suite
         green, destructive leak resumed). This file is the delete-the-fix
         counter-test that pins the FIXTURE's own closure.
