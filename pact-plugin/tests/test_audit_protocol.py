Tests for the pact-audit.md protocol and pact-auditor agent definition.

Tests cover:
1. Audit signal format validation (GREEN/YELLOW/RED with required fields)
2. Audit request format (dispatch conditions, completion lifecycle)
3. Auditor dispatch threshold consistency (protocol vs orchestrate.md)
4. Auditor agent definition structure
5. Completion lifecycle: signal-type with audit_summary

# =============================================================================
# The extract population declaration
# =============================================================================
#
# THE RULE, IN ONE SENTENCE: a file in pact-plugin/protocols is an extract
# unless it is the SSOT itself or it is named below. MEMBERSHIP READS NO BYTES
# OF A CANDIDATE, and that content-blindness is the whole point of the rule.
#
# WHY NO CONTENT PREDICATE MAY DECIDE MEMBERSHIP. A rule that inferred
# membership from a file's first line REMOVED that file at the instant its
# first line drifted, so the file left the population and the comparison below
# stopped covering it. THE GATE THEN WENT SILENT IN THE ONE STATE IT EXISTS TO
# REPORT. MEASURED on pact-agent-stall.md: a heading drift moved it from
# in-population to out-of-population; a drift in the body did not move it. Do
# not soften this into "read the first line as a hint". A hint that can REMOVE
# a candidate re-opens that hole by a second route.
#
# THE COST THIS BUYS, RECORDED SO IT IS NOT REDISCOVERED AS A DEFECT. A new
# STANDALONE document added to that directory joins the population by default
# and reddens the set arm until it is declared here. That red lands on correct
# work. It is accepted because it fires at the moment the file is added, by
# the person who holds the context, and because the failure message names the
# one-line repair. The alternative, an INCLUSION manifest, answers the same
# mistake with a permanent silent hole in the gate's own subject: a file added
# with no bookkeeping at all is simply absent from the manifest and nothing
# ever reports it.
#
# THIS SET MUST NOT BE DERIVED FROM THE SCRIPT. Not from its verify list, not
# generated from it by a build step or a hook, and not parsed from its
# run-time output. The two sides of the comparison are the GIT INDEX and the
# SCRIPT RUN, and a declaration taken from the script collapses them into one
# source that cannot disagree with itself.

        or any extract file desyncs the pair.

        Inserting content into the SSOT carries no separate bookkeeping
        obligation. The script anchors each section by its H2 heading text plus
        the next H2 heading as the end sentinel, NOT by line numbers, precisely
        so that adding or removing lines cannot shift a region out from under
        it. What this gate checks is byte-identity between an extract and its
        SSOT region; an edit to one half that is not mirrored into the other is
        the only way to break it.

    # -- The corpus of the extracts gate --------------------------------
    #
    # THE GATE ABOVE ASSERTS AN EXIT CODE AND READS NOTHING ELSE. The script
    # exits 0 when its FAILED count is 0, and an EMPTY corpus satisfies that.
    # MEASURED: with all nineteen `verify` calls removed the script prints
    # `Passed: 0, Failed: 0, VERIFICATION PASSED`, exits 0, and the gate above
    # stays GREEN. With ONE call removed it prints `Passed: 18, Failed: 0` and
    # the gate stays GREEN, so the extract that call covered goes unverified.
    #
    # A COUNT DERIVED FROM THE SCRIPT CANNOT CLOSE THAT. Remove one call and
    # the counted invocations and the reported PASS both read 18, so the two
    # agree and the arm passes. Two sides derived from ONE source cannot
    # disagree. THE INDEPENDENT ORACLE IS THE GIT INDEX, so the arms below
    # derive the population from the files git TRACKS in the protocols
    # directory and compare that against what the script names.
    #
    # AND THE SCRIPT IS ASKED WHAT IT DID, NOT WHAT ITS SOURCE TEXT LOOKS LIKE.
    # A rule that read the script SOURCE for `verify "<file>"` was MEASURED to
    # over-block twice against a CORRECT script, one that exits 0 with
    # `Passed: 19, Failed: 0`:
    #   * an ordinary usage message, a heredoc carrying one line at column zero
    #     of that shape, added a PHANTOM name and reddened the set comparison;
    #   * single quotes on the first argument, which bash treats identically to
    #     double quotes, emptied the parse and fired the NON-VACUITY assertion,
    #     which reads as a broken harness rather than as a defect in the rule.
    # NEITHER A TEXT LINE AT COLUMN ZERO NOR A QUOTE STYLE CAN CHANGE WHAT A
    # SCRIPT EMITS WHEN IT RUNS, so the verified set is now parsed from the
    # `VERIFY-CALL:` lines of a real run.
    #
    # THE INDEPENDENCE THIS RESTS ON, STATED SO A LATER EDIT CANNOT SPEND IT
    # WITHOUT NOTICING. THE TWO SIDES ARE THE GIT INDEX (with a filesystem
    # walk as the fall back) AND THE SCRIPT RUN. The script emits the literal
    # first argument of each call, so its side stays derived from the call
    # ARGUMENTS, and the population side is derived from what git TRACKS. A
    # git index cannot be changed by an edit to a shell script, and a shell
    # script cannot be changed by an edit to the index, so the two sides can
    # disagree and the comparison is therefore evidence.
    #
    # THE INDEPENDENCE MUST BE SPENDABLE ONLY ON PURPOSE, so here are the
    # three edits that spend it, each of which looks like a tidy-up:
    #   1. THE SCRIPT NAMES ITS FILES FROM A GLOB of the protocols directory.
    #      Both sides then derive from the directory and this comparison
    #      becomes a tautology that cannot disagree. The same obligation is
    #      recorded at the emission site in the script.
    #   2. THE DECLARATION IS GENERATED from the script by a build step or a
    #      hook, or the script is made to read the declaration.
    #   3. THE POPULATION IS PARSED FROM THE SCRIPT RUN-TIME OUTPUT. That
    #      route is newly available now that the script emits a file name for
    #      each comparison, so it is newly attractive. Do not take it.
    # THE INVARIANT BEHIND ALL THREE: NO SINGLE EDIT MAY REMOVE A FILE FROM
    # BOTH SIDES AT ONE TIME.

    # THE PROTOCOLS DIRECTORY, AS ONE STRING, because it is both a git
    # pathspec and a path segment and the two must not drift apart.

    @classmethod
    def _protocol_candidates(cls, repo_root):
        """Name every file in the protocols directory. Return (names, source).

        THE KEY SHAPE IS A JOINT CONTRACT WITH THE SCRIPT, so it is fixed here
        rather than chosen. Each name is THE PATH RELATIVE TO THE PROTOCOLS
        DIRECTORY, which is the same string the script prints, because the
        script is given that string as the first argument of a `verify` call
        and resolves it as `$PROTOCOLS_DIR/$file`. A key of any other shape
        (an absolute path, the repo-root-relative path, or a bare basename for
        a nested file) makes the two sets incomparable, and the comparison
        below then reddens against a CORRECT tree. MEASURED at 522a5129: `git
        ls-files -z pact-plugin/protocols` run from the repo root prints 22
        names of the form `pact-plugin/protocols/<name>`, unquoted, and after
        the prefix is removed the keys differ from the 19 emitted names by
        precisely the SSOT and the two declared standalone documents.

        THE GIT INDEX IS THE ORACLE, AND A FILESYSTEM WALK IS THE FALL BACK.
        MEASURED: with ONE UNTRACKED SCRATCH FILE in that directory, git
        reports 22 and a walk reports 23, and the walk therefore reddens a
        contributor's local run while CI stays green. That is a NEW OVER-BLOCK
        and this rule does not open one.

        A GIT-LESS TREE MUST NOT YIELD A SILENT EMPTY POPULATION. MEASURED:
        `git ls-files` in a tree with no repository returns 128 WITH EMPTY
        STDOUT and writes to stderr, so a reader that parses stdout alone gets
        a clean EMPTY population, and an empty population makes every set
        comparison pass. That is the tautology these arms exist to escape, and
        it renders as GREEN. So stdout is DISCARDED on a non-zero return code,
        the walk runs instead, and a zero-candidate route RAISES.

        THE FALL BACK IS A FALL BACK AND NOT A SKIP, and the cause is
        measured: in a `git archive` export the verify script itself continues
        to run and reports `Passed: 19, Failed: 0`, so a skip there would
        silence a live comparison.

        `-z` IS LOAD-BEARING. Without it, `core.quotePath` wraps a name
        carrying a non-ASCII or special character in double quotes with
        C-style escapes, and the key would then be a string nobody wrote.

        WHAT THIS ORACLE CANNOT SEE, named rather than left for a later
        reader to find:
          1. AN UNTRACKED FILE, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. A scratch file does not
             redden, which is the point, and a new extract that is not yet
             staged does not redden either, which is the price. Staging
             bounds the window, so a committed tree and CI always see it.
          2. THE INDEX AGAINST DISK. A tracked file removed from the working
             tree stays in the population, and the count arm reddens because
             the script reports one comparison fewer. The report is correct
             and its cause is the index.
          3. A FILE OUTSIDE THIS DIRECTORY. An extract copied elsewhere is
             not a candidate and nothing here reports it.
          4. CASE-FOLDING FILESYSTEMS. Two names differing only in case are
             one file on some platforms and two on others. NOT MEASURED.

        removed from the script leaves a file in the population and out of the

    """The lead-facing re-stamp instruction must carry its partial-write warning.

    THE SUBJECT. `TaskUpdate` merges metadata at the TOP LEVEL only, so a write
    that names `variety` REPLACES the whole object and erases each field it did
    not carry. Three lead-facing surfaces instruct the lead to RE-STAMP
    `metadata.variety` after it was already written, which is precisely that
    shape. Each of the three must state the hazard beside the instruction.

    WHY AN ARM AND NOT PROSE ALONE. The warning is prose that nothing executes.
    A later editor can drop it from one carrier while the other two keep it, and
    no run reports anything. That is the stale-twin direction, and it is the one
    failure this arm is built to catch.

    THIS ARM ASSERTS A PROPERTY, NOT A SENTENCE, AND THE DISTINCTION IS THE
    WHOLE DESIGN. An arm that pinned the wording would redden on any rewording
    that preserves the instruction, which is an over-block, and an arm that
    obstructs the next contributor gets removed rather than repaired. So the
    check requires three CONCEPTS near the instruction, each satisfied by any
    member of a synonym group:
      G1 REPLACEMENT: the write destroys what it did not carry.
      G2 WHOLE-OBJECT: the correction must re-send all of it.
      G3 READ-BACK: check the result on disk afterwards.
    A rewriter free to choose words stays green while all three concepts
    survive. Dropping one of the three reddens, which is correct, because each
    one alone leaves a lead able to reason its way back to a partial write.

    WHAT THIS ARM CANNOT SEE. It cannot judge whether the wording is CLEAR, and
    it cannot see a warning that states all three concepts incorrectly. It reads
    concept presence in a bounded window, nothing more.

    A MEASURED GAP THIS ARM DOES NOT CLOSE, RECORDED SO IT IS NOT READ AS
    COVERED. The same hazard is stated on two TEAMMATE-facing carriers, the
    rejection-correction step of the `pact-agent-teams` skill and Step 1 of the
    `pact-teachback` skill. NO arm reads either of those two. Their omission
    here is deliberate: widening this arm to cover them is a decision about
    another author's ruled scope, not a tidy-up.
