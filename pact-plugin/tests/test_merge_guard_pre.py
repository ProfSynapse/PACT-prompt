"""
Tests for merge_guard_pre._GH_PR_NUMBER_RE — PR-number extraction.

Pins the regex behavior: `_GH_FLAG_TOKENS` restricts BOTH flag-walks (between
`gh` and `pr`, AND between subcommand and PR number) to flag-shaped tokens
only (`-x`, `--long`, optionally `--flag value`). The `(?![\\w-])` negative-
lookahead on the (\\d+) capture rejects suffix matches inside longer
alphanumeric-or-hyphenated tokens.

Each TRUE-GAIN test below cites the exact OLD-vs-NEW behavioral delta — these
are the cases that were broken on main (regex captured a non-PR digit token
from heredoc body / 2>&1 redirect / trailing positional / branch-name suffix)
and now correctly extract the PR number or return None.

Two previously-xfail-strict cases are now FIXED in this file:

  1. "heredoc body containing a fully-formed `gh pr merge <N>` substring":
     `_GH_PR_NUMBER_RE` uses the tight `_GH_FLAG_TOKENS` form for BOTH the
     pre-subcommand AND post-subcommand flag walks (rather than reusing the
     broad `_GH_GLOBAL_FLAGS` for the pre-subcommand walk). This eliminates
     the re-anchor-at-second-occurrence authorization-bypass class.

  2. "branch-name suffix `7352-tests`": Python `\\b` IS a word boundary at
     digit-to-hyphen (word char `2` to non-word char `-`). The earlier spec
     assumed `\\b` would reject this; that assumption was wrong about Python
     regex semantics. The fix replaces the trailing `\\b` with `(?![\\w-])`
     (negative lookahead) — strictly stronger: rejects any continuation that
     is a word char OR a hyphen.

Both `test_heredoc_body_with_embedded_gh_pr_merge` and
`test_branch_name_with_digit_prefix_suffix_match` are now regular passing
tests pinning the fixes; the new `test_authorization_mismatch_attack` test
pins the end-to-end attack shape that the heredoc-side fix prevents.

# dash-initial token cannot be consumed AS A VALUE by that iteration; the outer
# `(?:...)*` consumes it AS A FLAG on the next one instead.
#
# THAT REPARTITIONING CHANGES WHICH DIGIT IS CAPTURED, and the constraint is
# therefore load-bearing for CORRECTNESS, not only for backtracking. Where the
# flag run stops decides which token is read as the positional PR number, and
# the unconstrained predecessor stops in a different place:
#
#   gh pr merge --squash -t 2024 42       constrained -> 42   pre-fix -> 2024
#   gh pr merge --squash --repo 2024 42   constrained -> 42   pre-fix -> 2024
#
# The predecessor captures the FLAG'S OWN ARGUMENT as the pull-request number.
# On a guard that binds an approval to a specific pull request, that is a
# TARGET-IDENTIFICATION defect: approve one pull request, authorise another.
#
# THE EXAMPLES ARE SHORT-FORM AND `--repo` BECAUSE THE LONG FORMS DO NOT SHOW
# IT. `_extract_pr_number` abstains when the token before the captured digit is
# in `_GH_PR_VALUE_TAKING_FLAGS`, and the caller then recovers the right target
# via `_extract_merge_target`. Every member of that frozenset is long-form, so
# `--subject`/`--body-file` are silently repaired while short aliases and
# `--repo` are not — see TestExtractPrNumberFlagFormAsymmetry below, which pins
# both arms. An earlier version of this comment used `--subject` and
# `--body-file`, so NEITHER of its examples actually misbound: a reader who
# checked them would have concluded the warning overclaimed.

# The long-form / short-form asymmetry, at the layer where it exists
# =============================================================================
# EVERY TEST ABOVE USES THE RAW REGEX, AND THE RAW REGEX TREATS A SHORT FLAG AND
# A LONG FLAG IDENTICALLY. The asymmetry lives one layer up, in
# `_extract_pr_number`, which re-checks the token preceding the captured digit
# against `_GH_PR_VALUE_TAKING_FLAGS` and abstains on a hit so the caller can
# recover the target. No test reached that layer, which is why prose was
# carrying the whole claim.
#
# THE ASYMMETRY IS COUNTERFACTUAL, and that is why no green-tree observation
# exhibits it. On the shipped pattern all of these return "42" and agree — the
# re-check never even fires, because the shipped capture is already the
# positional, so the token before it is a value rather than a flag. The
# frozenset exists to catch a MISBEHAVING pattern. So the only way to observe
# what it does and does not repair is to supply one, which this class does by
# swapping the compiled pattern for its unconstrained predecessor.
#
# IF YOU ARE ASKING WHY NO EXISTING TEST CAUGHT THIS, THE ANSWER IS STRUCTURAL
# AND NOT AN OVERSIGHT TO APPORTION: none could have. The claim being guarded is
# about what a FUTURE change would do, and a property of a change that has not
# been made is not observable in the tree that has not made it. Every arm here
# agrees on shipped code — that is the control below, not a weakness. So until
# someone built the counterfactual the claim had nowhere to live except prose,
# and prose is the one carrier with no failure mode. That is also why this class
# looks unusual: a counterfactual claim needs a counterfactual harness.
