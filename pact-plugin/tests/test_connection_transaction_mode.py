"""
Location: pact-plugin/tests/test_connection_transaction_mode.py

Summary: Arms for the transaction mode of the shipped connection factory. The
factory calls `sqlite3.connect` with NO `isolation_level` argument, so the
mode comes from a standard-library default rather than from a choice this
package states. These arms make that default a MEASURED property.

WHY THIS IS NOT A TEST ABOUT SQLITE. Two shipped mechanisms rest on it, and
each one is INERT rather than incorrect if the default ever moves.

  THE VECTOR WRITE PATH shares ONE TRANSACTION between the drop and the
  insert, by a `commit=False` flag on the drop helper. A shared transaction
  means something only when transactions are real on this connection. In
  autocommit the drop commits the moment it runs, the sharing is a fiction,
  and a failed insert costs the record its vector. That is the defect the
  flag was added to end, wearing the fix as a costume.

  THE CONNECTION-WIDE ROLLBACK in the embedding write path is correct because
  each caller commits its own work first. That argument needs a rollback that
  discards something. In autocommit it discards nothing for a different
  reason, and an arm built on the caller commits would pass whether or not
  those commits ran.

SO A GREEN HERE IS A PRECONDITION FOR TWO OTHER ARMS, AND NOT A RESULT OF ITS
OWN. Read it first.

THE MODE IS READ FROM THE LIVE CONNECTION, NEVER INFERRED FROM THE ABSENCE OF
AN ARGUMENT. An absent argument tells you what the caller did not say. It does
not tell you what the library chose, and the library default has moved between
versions before.
