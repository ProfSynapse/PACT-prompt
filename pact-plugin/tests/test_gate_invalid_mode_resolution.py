"""Coder-flagged item: the get_enum ADDITIVE stderr WARN (emitted when a *_MODE
env var is SET-but-invalid) must never CHANGE a gate's disposition, and must
never leak into the gate's stdout decision JSON.

WHAT THIS FILE CLAIMS, restated once more because the behaviour moved twice:
`PACT_DISPATCH_VARIETY_MODE` ships an ENFORCING default ("deny") but declares
`invalid_fallback = "warn"`, so an UNSET variable enforces while an UNPARSEABLE
one does not. Those are different user intents and the resolver now treats them
as such. The invariant is that resolution lands on the option's DECLARED
landing point for the path taken -- `default` for unset, `invalid_fallback` for
unrecognised -- and nowhere else, with the diagnostic on stderr.

Mechanism the tests pin:
- A set-but-invalid mode (e.g. "banana") resolves to that option's declared
  `invalid_fallback` -- "warn" for BOTH rows -- and never to anything derived
  from the invalid token.
- An UNSET variable resolves to that option's `default` -- "warn" for the
  inline-mission gate, "deny" for the dispatch-variety gate. **This is the arm
  carrying the discrimination**, because the invalid column coincides across
  the two rows and therefore cannot distinguish them.
  (TestInvalidModeResolvesToTheDeclaredFallback)
- The additive diagnostic is written to STDERR at gate import, so it cannot
  corrupt the gate's STDOUT decision JSON. (same class -- captures the reload
  stderr)
- Behaviorally, driving the REAL handoff_ordering_gate.main() while the invalid
  mode is active emits valid, uncorrupted JSON. (TestInvalidModeStdoutStaysClean)

Reload discipline: both gate modules resolve their mode constant at IMPORT, so we
reload under the invalid env and RESTORE them under a clean env at teardown
(without evicting from sys.modules -- sibling test files import + reload them and
would break if they vanished). Mirrors test_pact_config_gate_migration.

# and cannot tell them apart -- it would pass unchanged if one row's policy were
# deleted. The discrimination lives in the UNSET column, where they differ
# ("warn" vs "deny"). Verified by execution before this table was restructured,
# not reasoned about: an assertion whose two arms expect the same value is not
# a parametrisation, it is one arm run twice.
