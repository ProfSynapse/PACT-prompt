Summary: Arms for the vector write path of `PACTMemory._store_embedding`, and
behavioural arms for five claims about the `vec0` virtual table that the
design carried as prose and never executed.

WHY THE CARRIED-CLAIM ARMS ARE HERE AT ALL. The design of this write path
rests on five statements about a third-party virtual table. None of them had
been run. A design that rests on an unobserved premise is not wrong, but it
is unmeasured, and this arc has had three carried claims fall. Each of the
five is now an arm that can fail, so a later change to `sqlite_vec` reports
itself here rather than in the store of a user.

THE TWO WRITE-PATH ARMS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE, AND THIS IS THE POINT.

  THE BASIC REPLACE ARM asserts a second save replaces the vector without a
  fault. It goes RED against the unfixed path, because `vec0` refuses the
  insert on a row that is present.

  THE SEPARATING ARM asserts that a FAILED replacement leaves the ORIGINAL
  vector in place. It is GREEN against the unfixed path, because that path
  removes nothing before it inserts. It goes RED against the NAIVE FIX, the
  one that calls the drop helper with its default and so COMMITS the delete
  before the insert is attempted.

  So the two arms discriminate against DIFFERENT wrong implementations, and
  neither one alone certifies this fix. Read both labels before you reshape
  either.

WHY AN "EXPLICIT ROLLBACK" IS NOT THE REMEDY. `_drop_existing_vector` commits.
With the naive ordering, the delete is permanent before the insert runs, so
`rollback` returns the connection to a restore point that is itself the state
with the vector gone. The remedy is the ORDERING, and the `commit=False`
parameter is what supplies it. `TestACommitClosesTheRestorePoint` is the arm
that holds that reasoning up.
