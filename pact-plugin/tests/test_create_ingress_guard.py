Location: pact-plugin/tests/test_create_ingress_guard.py

Summary: Arms for the type guard at the create ingress of the memory store.
A list field that receives a bare string must RAISE. Before this guard, the
create ingress tested truthiness and passed the string into the merge, which
iterated it with `list()` and stored its characters.

READ THIS BEFORE YOU EDIT OR DELETE AN ARM BELOW. The three classes of arm
here are NOT interchangeable, and two of them cannot go red against the
change they accompany. Each one carries its own label. The labels are
load-bearing text.

  CLASS 1, THE REFUSAL ARMS. These assert `ValueError`. They go red against
  the unpatched create ingress AND against a mutant that turns the raise into
  a coercion. They are the witness for the guard.

  CLASS 2, THE UPDATE NON-REGRESSION ARM. It cannot go red against this
  change, because the update ingress carried the guard before this change was
  made. It pins that guard against removal. See its own docstring.

  CLASS 3, THE END-TO-END ARM. It asserts that the damage detector finds
  nothing after a save. It cannot go red against a coercion mutant, because a
  coercion produces no damage. See its own docstring.

WHY THE REFUSAL SPELLING AND NOT A DAMAGE SPELLING. An arm that asserts "the
stored field is not shredded" also goes red against the unpatched ingress, so
it looks adequate. It is green against a mutant that replaces the raise with
`return [value]`, because that mutant preserves the caller data whole. The
refusal spelling goes red against the unpatched ingress AND against that
mutant, at the same cost. Assert the REFUSAL, not the INTEGRITY OF THE DATA.

        CHANGE, AND THAT IS NOT A REASON TO DELETE IT.

        WHY IT CANNOT GO RED. `update_memory` routes each list field through
        `_normalize_list_field` at database.py:1094, which raises on a
        non-list, and it does that BEFORE the merge at :1102. So the update
        ingress carried this guard before the create-ingress change was made.
        The change edits the create ingress only. This arm gives the same
        result whether that change is applied or not.

        WHAT IT DOES PROVE. It pins the guard that protects the update
        ingress.

        THE MUTATIONS THAT DO MAKE IT RED, and they are the reason it ships:
          U1: delete the `_normalize_list_field` call at database.py:1094.
          U2: replace the raise at database.py:741-743 with `return [value]`.
        U2 is the dangerous one. It looks like a repair, because it preserves
        the caller data whole and produces no damage. It converts the contract
        from a REFUSAL into a SILENT ACCEPTANCE.

        IF YOU DELETE THIS ARM BECAUSE IT NEVER FAILS, the update guard loses
        its only witness and U1 or U2 lands later with nothing to stop it.
