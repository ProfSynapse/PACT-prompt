"""Drift detection for the two marker helpers twinned into `working_memory`.

THE TWO BODIES: `marker_line_span` and `_narrow_to_memory_region`, held in
`hooks/shared/pin_markers.py` (canonical) and copied into
`skills/pact-memory/scripts/working_memory.py`.

WHY A COPY AND NOT AN IMPORT, taken from the copy itself: the production entry
`cli.py` puts ONLY the skill root on `sys.path`, and `tests/conftest.py` puts
`hooks/` on it. So an import there RESOLVES BELOW PYTEST AND RAISES FROM THE
CLI, which is the failure direction that ships green.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED: no gate covered either body on
either side. Four behaviour-preserving renames, one for each of the four
bodies, left the full suite at its baseline count with zero failures, while
four behaviour-CHANGING controls on the same bodies reddened 89, 4, 88 and 4
tests. So the bodies were live and no gate saw a source change. The two
source docstrings that claimed a gate held them have since been corrected.

=====================================================================
THE ARITY IS TWO, AND IT IS TWO FOR A REASON WORTH WRITING DOWN
=====================================================================

The measurement above needed FOUR mutants, because each body is its own
mutation SITE and each needs its own run. A GATE DOES NOT MUTATE. IT
COMPARES, AND A COMPARISON IS SYMMETRIC: one assertion covers a change on
either side, because a change on either side breaks the same equality.

MEASURED BEFORE THIS FILE WAS WRITTEN, for each of the two functions:
    hooks mutated vs skills clean  -> not equal
    hooks clean   vs skills mutated -> not equal
So TWO comparisons cover four bodies. A four-arm gate would carry two
REDUNDANT arms, and a redundant arm is not free: it doubles the maintenance
and it makes a later reader believe two independent things are guarded.

This matches the convention in `test_staleness.py`, where each twinned
function carries ONE body comparison and the two-subject case is ONE
parametrized test.

=====================================================================
THE EXTRACTOR IS THE PARSING KIND, AND THAT IS A TRAP WARNING
=====================================================================

`_narrow_to_memory_region` has a MULTI-LINE SIGNATURE. A line-counting
extractor drops a fixed number of leading lines, so it leaves the parameter
lines and then the docstring in what it calls the body, AND THE TWO COPIES
THEN READ AS DIFFERENT. The two docstrings differ ON PURPOSE, because the
skills-side copy states only what is local.

SO A GATE BUILT ON A COUNTING EXTRACTOR IS RED ON ARRIVAL, AND THE NATURAL
REPAIR FOR THAT RED IS TO FORCE THE TWO DOCSTRINGS EQUAL, WHICH ERASES THE
LOCAL-ONLY CONTENT THE SKILLS COPY EXISTS TO CARRY. The second test below
pins that hazard as an executable fact, so a later author who swaps the
extractor reads the cause rather than reaches for the destructive repair.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT COVER. The SESSION boundary prefix is a twinned
CONSTANT rather than a twinned body, and it carries its own equality gate
plus a derivation arm in `test_working_memory_parser.py`. A constant needs a
value comparison and a body needs a source comparison, so it is not in scope
here and it does not need to be.
