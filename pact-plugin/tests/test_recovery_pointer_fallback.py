"""The recovery pointer survives a failure of the guard that bounds it.

WHAT THE POINTER IS FOR. The entry-cut design accepts TRUNCATION rather than
refusal, and the whole of that acceptance rests on one condition: the
`**Memory ID**` line survives, so the loss at that rendering is recoverable
from the store. A path that drops the pointer spends the guarantee the cut rule
rests on.

THE PATH THAT DROPPED IT. `_sanitize_prompt_field` catches bare `Exception` and
returns `""`, and the two recovery-key sites gate on the TRUTHINESS of its
output, so an internal failure inside the guard removed the pointer line in
silence. The helper cannot report WHY it returned empty, so the discriminator
is built at the caller: a NON-EMPTY input with an EMPTY output.

WHY THESE ARMS ASSERT BYTE EQUALITY AND NOT PRESENCE. The ruled design is an
ACCEPTOR: `_recover_identifier` returns the input UNCHANGED or nothing, so an
emitted pointer resolves against the store BY CONSTRUCTION. A labelled marker
was considered and REJECTED, because a labelled empty value reproduces the
defect this branch carries elsewhere: a pointer that is PRESENT and does NOT
RESOLVE. AN ARM THAT ASSERTED A LINE WAS PRESENT WOULD BE GREEN FOR THE
REJECTED DESIGN TOO, so it would not test the ruling at all. Equality with the
input is the assertion that separates the two.

THE PATCH SEAM IS INSTRUMENTED, BECAUSE A PATCH THAT MISSED WOULD LOOK LIKE A
PASS. If the forced failure did not reach the call site, the sanitize would
work, the line would be present, and an equality assertion would hold for the
wrong cause. So `_recover_identifier` is wrapped with a recorder, and each arm
asserts WHETHER IT RAN. The two directions together (it ran here, it did not
run in the control) are what prove the instrument is live.

WHAT THESE ARMS DO NOT COVER, STATED RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE FOUND.
1. LIVE REACHABILITY. No natural input is known that makes the shipped
   sanitize return empty for a non-empty id. These arms hold a CONDITIONAL: IF
   the guard returns empty for a non-empty id, THEN the pointer survives
   byte-identical. They do not claim the state is reachable in production.
2. THE INGRESS. Nothing bounds the identifier where it ENTERS the store, and
   no seat has measured which callers can supply one longer than the bound.
   The generator emits 32 characters against a bound of 64, so this path
   needs a caller the generator is not. `TestAnIdLongerThanTheBoundEmitsNoPointer`
   below makes the OUTPUT honest for such a value. It does not stop the value
   entering, and nothing tells a reader that one arrived: a REFUSED pointer is
   silent at the emit site, as an ABSENT one is.

THE SECOND CLASS BELOW CLOSED A DEFECT THIS FILE ONCE DECLARED OUT OF SCOPE,
AND THE HISTORY IS KEPT BECAUSE THE REASONING STAYS CORRECT. With the sanitize
at work, an id longer than the bound was CUT to the bound with a truncation
marker. A cut value is NON-EMPTY, so the empty-output gate could not fire, the
acceptor was unreachable and its own length refusal was dead code. The emitted
pointer was PRESENT and did NOT RESOLVE, which is the shape the acceptor exists
to avoid. Arming that state was correctly refused at the time, because
asserting the cut line would have PINNED AN OPEN DEFECT. The source now defers
that id to the acceptor, so the arms assert the REFUSAL rather than the cut.
