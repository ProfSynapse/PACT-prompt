"""The census instrument's own check, run against a SYNTHETIC corpus.

NO ARM HERE PINS A REAL-WORLD COUNT. The journal population includes the
handoffs written while measuring it -- it moved by 3 events between this
arc's own runs -- so any test asserting a number from the live roots rots by
the next session. These arms build a fixture corpus under tmp_path, where the
expected counts are known by construction, and assert the instrument reports
what was planted.

The one arm that touches the shipped code rather than the fixture is
test_key_set_reconstruction_is_faithful: it guards the adaptation the journal
arm depends on.
