"""Hoist parity: `_is_teachback_subject` was moved from task_lifecycle_gate.py
to shared/task_utils.py (as the public `is_teachback_subject`) so a second hook
surface — the handoff_ordering_gate PreToolUse WARN — can reuse the predicate
without importing the sibling PostToolUse gate module.

These tests pin three properties the hoist must preserve:

  1. SINGLE DEFINITION — the gate re-imports the shared function (its
     `_is_teachback_subject` IS `task_utils.is_teachback_subject`), and the
     canonical regex `_TEACHBACK_SUBJECT_PATTERN` is NOT duplicated back into
     the gate source. Duplication would reopen the drift class the structural
     match was introduced to close.
  2. BEHAVIORAL PARITY — the shared function returns the same verdict the gate's
     predicate always returned across canonical / non-canonical / non-string
     inputs (the move is behavior-preserving, not a re-spec).
  3. PURITY — never raises on hostile input (mirrors the pre-hoist contract).

A fourth property is pinned below, added when the pattern's tail was widened
from the literal `TEACHBACK for ` to a word boundary:

  4. WORD-BOUNDARY TAIL — a gate that qualifies the marker before the mission
     (`preparer: TEACHBACK (respawn) for …`) matches, while the marker must
     still stand as its own word (`TEACHBACKS` does not). Every subject the
     strict trailing-space form matched still matches: the widening is a
     superset, never a re-aim.
