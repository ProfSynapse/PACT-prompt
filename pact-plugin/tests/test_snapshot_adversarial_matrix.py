Summary: TEST-phase adversarial/boundary depth for task_metadata_snapshot —
         exact cap boundaries (per-value and payload, computed against the
         imported substrate constants, never re-declared), the dual-cap
         interaction case (N same-size values each under the per-value cap
         whose total exceeds the payload cap), jumbo emit-level payloads
         over a REAL tmp journal, pathological-input characterizations
         (non-JSON-serializable values; NaN floats), the §6 task-id-reuse
         occupant join, and the substrate-level writability defer.

         Complements (never duplicates) the CODE-phase suites: the
         substrate unit file pins stage semantics with synthetic jumbos;
         THIS file pins the exact boundary arithmetic, the emit-level
         behavior of hostile inputs through the REAL append_event/
         read_events pair, and the reader-side join contract.

Harness: the L2 exemplar seam (test_agent_handoff_emitter_integration.py) —
Path.home -> tmp + the pact_context fixture; REAL journal writes and reads,
no append_event spy. Characterization tests are labeled as such in their
docstrings: they document CURRENT behavior for the pending-disposition
record, not an endorsed contract.

# What the allowance below bounds, stated because the bare number did not say.
# THIS IS AN ENVELOPE ALLOWANCE AND NOT A FRACTION OF THE CAP. A journal line
# is the capped payload PLUS the event envelope: the type, ts, task_id,
# subject, occupant and owner fields, the JSON punctuation, and the escaping
# growth of the payload under ensure_ascii. The allowance bounds THAT, so it
# is an absolute size and the cap is not its denominator.
# WHY THAT MATTERS: PAYLOAD_CAP doubled from 64 KiB to 128 KiB, so this
# allowance fell from 25 percent of the cap to 12.5 percent. THAT DRIFT IS
# NOT A WEAKENING, because the percentage was never the quantity. The
# assertion catches its stated defect at either cap: a raw multi-megabyte
# value reaching the journal line overruns this by two orders of magnitude.
# Re-derive this number only if the ENVELOPE grows, and do not scale it with
# the cap.
# THE TWO MEASUREMENT FORMS IN THIS FAMILY CANNOT DISAGREE, AND THE CAUSE IS
# STRUCTURAL RATHER THAN LUCKY. The three sites that hold this bound do not
# all measure the same unit: one takes len() of the encoded bytes and two take
# len() of the str, which is CHARACTERS. append_event serializes with the
# json.dumps default ensure_ascii=True, so every non-ASCII character reaches
# the line as an escape sequence and the line is PURE ASCII. For an ASCII
# string the character count EQUALS the byte count, so the two forms return
# one number. MEASURED on a line carrying accented text, CJK and an emoji:
# 180 characters and 180 bytes. So this is not a repair and no site needs to
# change. It is a record, and it is load-bearing for ONE case: a change to
# ensure_ascii would separate the two units at these three sites in silence,
# which is a fourth consequence of the parameter the serializer contract
# enumerates at this time.
