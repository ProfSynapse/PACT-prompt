    Recovery step 4 of the harvest skill.

    Step 4 used to instruct an unguarded removal of the files the recovery

    carrier of a given HANDOFF: the session journal holds the tasks that
    emitted an ``agent_handoff`` event, and the task files hold a quiescent
    completed task of which the key reached no journal. The repaired step
    removes nothing, and its carrier test gates the Step 5 report instead.

    That instruction is LLM-read prose with no runtime path, so no
    behavioural test reaches it. This pin closes that gap. Each of the three
    phrases pins a different property: the first pins the instruction, the
    second pins the processed-is-not-removable inference, and the third pins
    the carrier test. A single phrase lets two of the three go missing
    behind a green suite.

    WHAT THIS CANNOT CATCH, stated so that a green is read no wider than it
    is: a rewording that keeps a phrase and defeats it in the next
    paragraph, a contradicting instruction added elsewhere in the file, and
    a phrase moved into a section it does not govern. It also cannot
    separate a deliberate rewording from a regression.
