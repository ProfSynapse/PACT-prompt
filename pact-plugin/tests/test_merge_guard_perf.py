"""Worst-case performance-bound regression tests for the merge-guard global-flag
prefixes (#1001 / F1).

Root cause being pinned
-----------------------
``_GH_GLOBAL_FLAGS`` / ``_GIT_GLOBAL_FLAGS`` in
``shared/merge_guard_common.py`` were ``(?:\\S+\\s+)*`` — an unbounded greedy
walk of "any token". ``\\S`` and ``\\s`` are disjoint, so a single walk is
internally unambiguous; the quadratic is the *multi-anchor* interaction: on a
command text with many ``git``/``gh`` anchor tokens, ``re.search`` retries the
walk at every anchor and each retry greedily consumes to end-of-string looking
for the following verb (``push``/``pr``/``branch``/``api``). Per-anchor cost
O(N) × N anchors = **O(N^2)**.

The fix bounds the walk to ``(?:\\S+\\s+){0,32}`` (``_MAX_GLOBAL_FLAG_TOKENS``),
so each anchor consumes at most 32 tokens => O(32)=O(1) per anchor => the whole
scan is **linear**.

Functions pinned
----------------
Both detection paths embed the prefix constants and were INDEPENDENTLY quadratic
(PREPARE probe E):

* ``is_dangerous_command``            — the read-side ``DANGEROUS_PATTERNS`` bank;
* ``detect_command_operation_type``   — the shared classifier, called by BOTH
  the pre- and post-hooks.

Witness
-------
``"git x " * N``: many anchors,
**no shell separators** — the pure pathological shape that maximises the
multi-anchor retry cost. Each ``x`` is a non-verb token, so the scan runs every
prefix pattern to completion (no early dangerous-match short-circuit).

Assertion strategy (CI-robust — NOT exact-ms; design §7.2)
----------------------------------------------------------
Two mutually reinforcing assertions per case:

* **Absolute wall-clock ceiling** (PRIMARY discriminator). The unbounded/quadratic
  form is ~1.8 s (gh detect) to ~7.3 s (gh read) at N=4000. The ceiling sits
  clear of linear and below quadratic, so it cannot flap on a slow machine yet
  still trips on a regression.

  BOUNDED COSTS ARE QUOTED AT ``N_LARGE`` BELOW, NOT AT N=4000. Every figure
  in this module once described N=4000 while the arms ran at 8000, which
  understated one of them ~30x and makes a ceiling look safer than it is. Each
  per-case comment now carries its measured ``t_large`` and the margin that
  follows from it.
* **Scaling ratio** ``t(2N)/t(N) < 3.0`` across one doubling. Linear ≈ 2.0,
  quadratic ≈ 4.0; 3.0 is the midpoint. ``best-of-K`` minimum timing suppresses
  upward scheduler/GC noise (a slow sample never lowers the min).

Counter-test-by-revert (non-vacuity)
------------------------------------
Restore the unbounded ``*`` form (the shared prefix constants) and re-run: the
ratio returns to ~4x AND the N=4000 wall-clock blows past the ceiling => the
targeted case goes RED. Expected cardinality: reverting the shared constants
(``_GIT_GLOBAL_FLAGS`` / ``_GH_GLOBAL_FLAGS``) reds the corresponding git / gh
cases.

# the multi-anchor interaction; design §12.2). This case PINS structural linearity
# (ratio < 3.0): a future nested-quantifier regression in the push patterns would
# trip it. It is GREEN-stays-GREEN — reverting the `{0,32}` push bound keeps it

# its 2.0 s ceiling and leaves BOTH push cases green — so the counter-factual
# that exists for git/gh does not reach these, exactly as the paragraph above
# says. What remains is a guard against a hypothetical future nested-quantifier
# regression, and the absolute ceiling below guards the same hypothetical with
# far more room:

#   — 1.07x of room. t_large med 175-310 ms against the 1.0 s ceiling below —
#   3.3x of room. Neither is counter-testable today; keeping the one that will
#   not false-fire and dropping the one that will is the whole trade.

# and it STILL FLAKED: measured 1.98 in isolation and 3.08 under a loaded
# full-suite run, against the 3.0 ceiling. Being in the band is NECESSARY BUT
# NOT SUFFICIENT — the floor fixes a small-denominator problem, and this is a
# different one. Contention inflated the two arms UNEQUALLY (1.5x on the small,
# 2.4x on the large), and a ratio cannot subtract that: the asymmetry lands
# entirely in the quotient.
#
# The direction is what makes it unacceptable rather than merely annoying. A

# A ratio separates LINEAR from QUADRATIC, and it is the right instrument for
# every arm above, because a quadratic arm still TERMINATES — you get two
# numbers and divide them. The properties below are EXPONENTIAL, and a ratio
# cannot measure an exponential: computing it requires the larger arm to finish,
# and the larger arm is the one that does not. A regression would arrive as a CI
# TIMEOUT rather than a red test, which reports as infrastructure trouble rather
# than as the defect.
#
# So these use a BOUNDED input with a generous absolute ceiling — and the
# constants are justified by the complexity difference they separate, not by a
# baseline on one machine. Each is measured in BOTH states below, and the gaps
# are five orders of magnitude, so no runner is slow enough to confuse them.

    through `is_dangerous_command` and through `detect_command_operation_type`,
    on the worst witness available, and FLAT in the adversarial region — 0.12 ms
    at 16 units and still 0.13 ms at 28, where a reachable form costs 42 s.

    The pattern in ISOLATION is EXPONENTIAL, and worse than the `_GH_FLAG_TOKENS`
    backtracker that was fixed on this branch. Forced to fail a full match, the
    `$''` and `$""` witnesses cost roughly 16x PER ADDED UNIT — 7 ms at 16 units,
    111 ms at 20, 1.75 s at 24, and 28.7 SECONDS at 28 units, which is an
    85-CHARACTER input. The flag-token backtracker needed ~46 tokens to reach the
    same place. Controls, so the cause is not guessed: a bare `$` repetition and
    a plain-character run are FLAT (~1.2x), so the ambiguity is specifically the
    three `$`-initial arms, where a `$` can begin `$'...'`, begin `$"..."`, or
    stand alone.

    THE TWO FACTS ARE RECONCILED BY POSITION. The token ends with `+` and NOTHING
    FOLLOWS IT in the one pattern that uses it, so the greedy match always
    succeeds and no alternative partition is ever explored. Add a required
    element after it and every partition becomes reachable — the same positional
    argument that makes the quote-aware span safe, and the same one that did NOT
    hold for the flag-token walk, which had required elements after it.

    So the load-bearing guard is STRUCTURAL, not a timing ladder. A ladder pins
    the linearity; it cannot see the edit that removes the reason for it, because
    the witness that would expose the edit depends on what the edit appended.
    This class pins the precondition itself: no timing, no flake, no dependence
    on a runner, and it reddens on the exact change that makes 28 seconds
    reachable.

    THIS IS NOT A DENIAL-OF-SERVICE FINDING and must not be reported as one.
    The cost is bounded by command length, and command length is bounded by what
    a person types.

    MEASURED through the shipped `_shell_tokenize`, and the pairing is the
    finding: the cost tracks QUOTE DENSITY, and is indifferent to whether the
    quotes balance. An odd quote count raises inside shlex and the wrapper
    abstains; an even one tokenises successfully. Both cost the same:

        length    odd quotes (abstains)   even quotes (succeeds)
         40,001              7.19 ms                  7.08 ms

        320,001            291.76 ms                288.56 ms

    k is roughly 1.7-2.2 on both. THE CONTROL IS WHAT LOCATES THE CAUSE: plain
    input with NO quotes measures 1.99-2.03x per doubling — clean linear — so
    the super-linearity belongs to quote handling, not to tokenisation in
    general and not to the failure path.

    That last point is worth stating plainly because the natural reading is the
    opposite one. This cost is NOT confined to malformed commands; a
    well-formed, successfully-tokenised command pays exactly the same. Reaching
    it needs no mistake at all — only quotes.

    AT REAL COMMAND LENGTHS THE COST IS STILL NEGLIGIBLE, which is what makes
    the acceptance sound: 0.015 ms at 100 characters, 0.27 ms at 2,000, 1.14 ms
    at 8,000.

    Accepted by the team lead on review of these measurements, on the grounds
    the issue itself states: the finding is LOW and must not be reported as a
    denial-of-service. Recorded here rather than only in the tracker so the
    acceptance is discoverable from the code it applies to.

    NO RECURRING TIMING ARM IS SHIPPED FOR THIS, and the omission is the
    decision rather than an oversight. A wall-clock arm on an ACCEPTED risk
    buys no gate value — there is no defect for it to catch, because the
    super-linearity is expected and permitted — while adding flake surface to
    a suite where a timing bound reding on a loaded runner is a known,
    separately-tracked problem. The standing rule for a finding with no
    defensible action is to RECORD it, not to answer it with a test. The
    numbers above are the record; only the behavioural contract below is
