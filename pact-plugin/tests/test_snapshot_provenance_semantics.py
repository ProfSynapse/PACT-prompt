Summary: Assertion suite for the PROVENANCE-tracked marker-identity ruling
         in build_snapshot_payload (freeze doc §3): marker identity is a
         local this-run set, never a shape test. A caller value that merely
         LOOKS marker-shaped is ordinary data — a normal stage-2 eviction
         candidate re-markered with its TRUE sizes — and stage 3's
         original_bytes sort only ever sees this run's own int-bearing
         markers (total by construction). Extends the YELLOW-1 adversarial
         class (caller-owned marker-shaped input) from stage 3a to every
         stage, and pins the totality invariant: every input key survives
         in the payload or in _dropped_keys.

============================ NON-VACUITY ========================================
The lookalike-eviction assertions are coupled to the provenance mechanism by
a behavioral discriminator, not by presence: under the superseded
shape-tested candidacy, a lookalike was eviction-EXEMPT and its bogus
original_bytes survived verbatim (and a non-int original_bytes raised
TypeError inside the hermetic emit = silently dropped snapshot). Reverting
the provenance commit flips test_lookalike_is_evicted_with_true_sizes,
test_all_lookalike_payload_*, and test_non_int_original_bytes_* to red.

def _floor_key_count(key_width: int) -> int:
    """Keys needed to overrun PAYLOAD_CAP with EMPTY-HEAD markers.

    Stage 3b is reachable only when the markers of this run, with their
    heads emptied, are STILL above the payload cap. That count depends on
    the two caps and on the key width, so derive it rather than freeze it:
    an earlier version of these tests hardcoded 1500 against a 64 KB cap
    and silently stopped reaching the floor when the cap moved.

    KEEP THE KEY NAME NARROW. A wide key reaches the floor at a much lower
    count, which is tempting because the count drives the runtime. It also
    moves the test into a DIFFERENT REGIME. Stage 3b records each dropped
    name in a "_dropped_keys" list, so a wide name inflates the marker cost
    and the drop-list cost together, and the drop list itself then overruns
    the cap. That overrun is a documented residual of stage 3b, and a
    fixture that lands in it stops measuring ordinary floor behaviour.

    THE RESIDUAL IS UNBOUNDED. DO NOT SIZE A DEFENCE AGAINST ANY ONE
    OBSERVATION OF IT. Stage 3b keeps the NAME of each key it drops, so the
    residual payload is the SUM OF ALL DROPPED KEY-NAME LENGTHS, and nothing
    in the stage limits either factor: not the key count, and not the width
    of a single name. The overrun therefore has no ceiling that this code
    establishes. Two measurements, both at a 131072 cap, show the spread and
    neither is the maximum: a 400-character key gave 233255 bytes, and a
    later arm gave 836019 bytes, 6.4 times the cap, with ZERO keys kept in
    all four arms. A reader given one number sizes a defence against that
    number, which is why the property and not an observation is recorded
    here. A narrow key keeps a wide margin between the two costs and holds
    the test in the regime it names.
