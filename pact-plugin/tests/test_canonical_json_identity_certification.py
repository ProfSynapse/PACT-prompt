"""Certification of the SHARING invariant: both marker families hash through
ONE serializer object.

WHAT THIS FILE COVERS THAT test_canonical_json_contract.py CANNOT. That file
pins the BYTES `shared.canonical_json.canonical_bytes` produces, against
hand-typed expectations, and it is the correct protection for the three
serialization parameters. It exercises the SHARED OBJECT, so it stays GREEN
while the two families stop using that object. The header of canonical_json.py
enumerates the terms of the import contract and states that a change to the
module path or the exported name gives an ImportError. A FOURTH FAILURE MODE
IS NOT ON THAT LIST AND FAILS LOUDLY AT NO SITE:

  A SECOND DEFINITION. A re-added local `_canonical_bytes` in
  task_metadata_snapshot.py, or a second `json.dumps` in
  agent_handoff_marker.py, breaks NO import. The contract file keeps passing.
  The two families then compute DIFFERENT keys for one mapping, which is the
  divergence the extraction exists to prevent.

The protection against that was a prose line in the module header saying not
to re-add a local definition. A prose claim adjacent to a green suite is what
this arc measured as insufficient for the serialization parameters, and it is
the same shape here.

THE PROPERTY UNDER CERTIFICATION IS NOT THAT canonical_bytes SERIALIZES ONE
WAY. It is that BOTH FAMILIES HASH THROUGH THIS ONE OBJECT.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE GUARD IS COPIED, NOT INVENTED, AND THE PRECEDENT IS NAMED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
test_lock_identity_certification.py certifies shared-object identity for the
`file_lock` / `_atomic_write_text` pair through `__module__`, and its own
docstring records why `__module__` rather than `inspect.getsourcefile()`:
`functools.wraps` copies `__module__` through a decorator, so it stays
correct, while `getsourcefile()` resolves a decorated wrapper to
contextlib.py for every twin and fails in both directions. This file uses the
same instrument for the same class of claim.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TWO INSTRUMENTS, BECAUSE ONE OF THE TWO FAILURE MODES IS INVISIBLE TO THE
FIRST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. OBJECT IDENTITY (`__module__` plus `is`). This catches a REBOUND name: a
   family that defines its own `_canonical_bytes` and shadows the import.
2. A SOURCE SCAN for a second serializer. `__module__` CANNOT see this one.
   A module can keep importing the shared object, keep the binding correct,
   and call `json.dumps` at a NEW site adjacent to it. The shared object stays
   right while the family stops going through it, so instrument 1 answers
   GREEN about a question it was not asked.

THE SOURCE SCAN PARSES, IT DOES NOT GREP, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING. Both
family modules discuss `json.dumps` IN PROSE, in the comments explaining why a
second serialization must not be added. A line-oriented search finds those
sentences and cannot separate them from a call. An AST walk sees calls and
does not see comments.
