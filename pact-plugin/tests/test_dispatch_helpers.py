"""Direct unit coverage for shared/dispatch_helpers.py structural predicates.

Housed in its OWN file rather than a consumer's: these predicates are shared
infrastructure with more than one consumer, so coverage that lives inside any
single consumer's test file dies when that consumer is refactored or retired —
the predicate would silently lose its only direct tests with nothing going red.

Scope here is the PURE predicates (no FS, no team config, no context). The
resolution helpers that read team config are exercised against a seeded config
in the consumer suites.

is_owner_wiring_shape recognizes ONE leg of the ordering gate's dispatch
recognition — the SHAPE of the COMPOSITE owner-wiring write. The other legs
(owner resolves to a pact specialist; subject is not a teachback gate) and
the per-consumer exemption predicate are deliberately NOT its business; the
scope-boundary tests at the bottom are what keep them out.

is_owner_bearing_write is the BROADER sibling the dispatch_site population
keys on: live dispatch practice wires owners in split writes (owner in one
update, blockers elsewhere), so the composite is dark by construction as a
population membership leg. The two predicates are deliberately NOT unified —
relaxing the composite in place would silently change the ordering gate.

Note on vocabulary: handoff_ordering_gate calls this write "terminal", a term
that file DEFINES locally as "both halves present" (as against a partial
one-half write). The shared helper says "shape" instead because that local
definition does not travel to a module with several consumers — the two names
describe the same predicate, not different ones.
