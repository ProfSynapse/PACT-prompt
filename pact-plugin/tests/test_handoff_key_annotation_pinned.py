"""Structural pin for the HANDOFF prose-label / canonical-key annotation.

The four LLM-loaded surfaces that teach the six-item HANDOFF template carry an
annotation, above the fence, naming the canonical `metadata.handoff` keys that
correspond to the prose display labels:

  1. pact-plugin/protocols/pact-phase-transitions.md
  2. pact-plugin/protocols/pact-protocols.md (SSOT mirror of the above)
  3. pact-plugin/commands/rePACT.md
  4. pact-plugin/skills/pact-agent-teams/SKILL.md

WHY THIS PIN EXISTS, AND WHY THE EXISTING GATE DOES NOT COVER IT.
verify-protocol-extracts.sh checks that the extract and the SSOT AGREE WITH
EACH OTHER. It does not check that either one SAYS anything in particular, so
it stays green when the annotation is deleted from BOTH protocol files in the
same commit. pact-phase-transitions.md is named by no other test file. So
before this pin, deleting the annotation from any of the four surfaces was
silent, and the one gate that looks like coverage was checking a different
property. This pin asserts CONTAINMENT AT EACH NAMED SURFACE, never agreement
between files.

THREE MARKERS, PINNED AS LITERALS, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. All three are
restated here rather than imported. Building the expected value from
HANDOFF_CANONICAL_FIELDS would make this pin green whenever the docs and the
code drift TOGETHER, which is the failure a doc pin exists to catch. The one
arm that DOES import is test_doc_key_sequence_matches_shipped_canonical_fields
below, because it asserts doc-against-code and must read the code's actual
value. The two kinds of arm obey opposite rules on the same literal:

  - the literal pins catch the DOCS changing
  - the imported arm catches the docs and the code DIVERGING

A change made to both together passes the imported arm and fails the literal
pins. That is correct: it is a deliberate contract change and it should
require a test edit.

PER-FILE COUNTS, NOT A REPO-WIDE TOTAL. A repo-wide count stays green when a
phrase MOVES from one file to another, which is exactly the erosion this pin
is for.

POPULATION, STATED BESIDE THE CLAIM. These four are the ANNOTATED surfaces.
They are not every surface naming the six keys: agents/pact-orchestrator.md
also names all six, in canonical order, in a pre-existing sentence that gives
them directly as JSON keys. That sentence carries no prose display labels
beside them, so there is no label-to-key trap there and nothing to annotate.
It is why ANNOTATION_MARKER, not CANONICAL_KEY_SEQUENCE, is the marker that
identifies the annotation: the key sequence occurs on five surfaces, the
annotation phrase on exactly these four.

Counter-test-by-revert (manual): delete the annotation paragraph from any one
surface and this module reds with that surface named -- by the presence arm,
the drift arm and the count arm for that file.
