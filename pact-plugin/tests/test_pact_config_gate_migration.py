"""C2 equivalence tests: routing the two *_MODE gate reads through
shared.pact_config.get_enum must preserve the pre-refactor resolved mode
EXACTLY at BOTH gate sites.

Before C2, dispatch_gate.py and handoff_ordering_gate.py each resolved their
mode inline as:  os.environ.get(NAME, DEFAULT).strip().lower()  then a frozenset
membership check falling back to DEFAULT. `_old_resolve` below is that exact
logic, used as the oracle. The acceptance bar is: for every input in the battery
(valid values, invalid, whitespace, mixed case, unset), the new resolution ==
the old resolution.

SCOPE OF THE EQUIVALENCE CLAIM, and it is narrower than it first reads: what
C2 had to preserve is the RESOLUTION MECHANISM -- normalization, membership,
and fall-back-to-the-declared-default. It is NOT a claim that a given option's
default never changes. The two options now declare DIFFERENT defaults on
purpose (`_DEFAULT` below), so the oracle is parameterised by the declared
default rather than pinning one literal for both; pinning one would turn a
deliberate policy change into a red test, which is the shape that gets a policy
reverted to keep a suite green.

Two layers:
- TestResolverValueEquivalence drives pact_config.get_enum directly (full
  input coverage, cheap).
- TestGateSiteWiring reloads the REAL gate modules under each input and reads
  their module-level mode constant -- proving the RHS swap is actually wired
  (catches a composed-but-unwired resolver or a wrong env-var name), not merely
  that get_enum is correct in isolation.
