"""Frame-gate arms for the six sites that moved from is_lead to
is_canonical_journal_frame.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The substitution shipped with a green suite, and the
suite was green BEFORE the change and AFTER it. The arms in this repository
were insensitive to the substitution in the two directions, so the green
proved that nothing broke and proved nothing about the substitution.

🔴 WHY THE OLD ARMS COULD NOT SEE IT, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED.
``is_canonical_journal_frame`` returns True IMMEDIATELY when ``is_lead`` is
True, and only then falls to the topology leg. So in a lead frame that
carries a lead ``agent_type``, THE TWO PREDICATES GIVE THE SAME ANSWER and a
revert is invisible. The ONLY frame class that separates them is
``is_lead`` False AND ``is_canonical_journal_frame`` True, which needs the
topology leg to resolve.

🔴 THE TOPOLOGY LEG NEEDS TWO HALVES, AND ONE HALF IS A TRAP. It needs a
frame ``session_id`` AND a team config carrying a ``leadSessionId`` that
agrees with it. WITH ONE HALF THE PREDICATE ANSWERS False, WHICH IS THE SAME
ANSWER ``is_lead`` GIVES. So an arm built on one half is green with the
substitution and green without it, AND IT READS AS TESTED because it does
drive the site. That is an equality between two outcomes rather than a
defect in the arm: no arm confined to that frame class can discriminate,
however carefully it is written. ``test_four_point_control`` pins all four
points so a later editor cannot seed one half and believe it is covered.

🔴 THREE OBSERVABLE CLASSES, NOT ONE, AND NOT TWO. The sites do not share
one channel, and an arm that watches the wrong one reports a driven site as
silent.

  1. THE JOURNAL RECORD. Five of the six sites append a record. They do NOT
     all append it through one function object: ``dispatch_variety`` and
     ``teachback_ack`` go through ``append_event_checked`` (which calls
     ``session_journal.append_event``), the lead-side handoff emit calls the
     ``append_event`` name IMPORTED INTO task_lifecycle_gate, and the
     snapshot emits call the name imported into task_metadata_snapshot.
     A rig that patches ONE of those three names sees a subset of the sites
     and reports the rest as silent. THAT IS AN INSTRUMENT DEFECT AND IT
     READS AS A FINDING ABOUT THE CODE. This file mocks NONE of them: it
     redirects ``Path.home`` and reads the REAL on-disk journal, so all
     three routes land in one place by construction and no future emit can
     escape the instrument by changing which name it calls.
  2. THE ADVISORY. The artifact-paths site appends to the RETURN VALUE of
     ``evaluate_lifecycle`` and writes no journal record at all.
  3. THE CALL. A site can be REACHED, CALLED, and still write nothing,
     because the emitter dedups on an O_EXCL marker or drops an ineligible
     payload. An arm that reads only the downstream artifact collapses three
     states into one empty list: not reached, reached but gate-rejected, and
     called but deduplicated. ``emit_calls`` records that layer so the three
     stay separable.

SIX SITES, ALL COVERED HERE, cited by symbol because line numbers move:
``dispatch_variety`` (TaskCreate branch), the lead-side ``agent_handoff``
emit at the acceptance-commit, the ``artifact_paths_emit_missing`` advisory,
``teachback_ack`` (TaskUpdate-completed branch), the post-completion handoff
backstop, and the post-completion ``task_metadata_snapshot`` backstop.

HOW THE TWO BACKSTOPS ARE SEPARATED, because they share one frame class and
a shared arm would kill two mutants at once and name neither. The handoff
backstop needs an incoming ``metadata.handoff`` DICT. The snapshot backstop
excludes ``handoff`` from its payload and emits nothing when that is the
only key. So a handoff-ONLY write drives the handoff backstop alone, and a
write carrying only a non-handoff key drives the snapshot backstop alone.

R5 IS OUT OF SCOPE AND IS NAMED SO A READER DOES NOT EXPECT IT.
``_journal_lifecycle_decision`` writes a ``lifecycle_decision`` record with
NO frame gate, in EVERY frame. It is called from ``main()`` rather than from
``evaluate_lifecycle``, so it does not reach the arms below. The arm-D
controls assert silence FOR THE RECORD KIND OF THEIR OWN SITE anyway, never
journal silence in general, so a future move of that call cannot turn them
red for a defect this commit does not own.

    at these two kinds is not evidence of a defect this commit introduced,
