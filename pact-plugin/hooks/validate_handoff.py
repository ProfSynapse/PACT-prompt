Summary: SubagentStop hook that validates PACT agent/teammate handoff format.
Used by: Claude Code hooks.json SubagentStop hook (fires for both background
         Task agents and Agent Teams teammates)

Validates that PACT agents complete with proper handoff information
(produced, decisions, next steps) in their transcript text.

Note: Task protocol compliance (status, metadata) is NOT validated here.
Task state may still be in flux at SubagentStop time (agents self-manage
status under Agent Teams, and the team-lead may process output after this hook
fires), so Task state cannot be reliably checked here.

CANONICAL STRUCTURED HANDOFF (do NOT relocate this hook): this hook
validates the PROSE form of a HANDOFF in the agent transcript and is a
legacy, IN-PROCESS-only convenience. The STRUCTURED 6-field handoff lives in
`metadata.handoff`, and its PRESENCE is handled lead-side at acceptance-commit
by `_emit_lead_side_agent_handoff` in task_lifecycle_gate.py — its
emit-eligibility short-circuits on an absent handoff — and therefore fires in
BOTH teammate modes (in-process AND separate-process). (A completion-time
advisory branch that once emitted `handoff_missing` / `handoff_schema_invalid`
there was permanently dormant under the bare-owner convention and has been
retired.) This SubagentStop prose check does NOT fire for a separate-process
(e.g. tmux/iTerm2) teammate — such a teammate fires its OWN Stop/SessionEnd,
never a SubagentStop in the lead's process — so the prose refusal is simply
absent there. That absence is intentional and acceptable: the lead-side
presence handling above already covers both modes. Do NOT "restore" this prose
check onto a teammate end-of-life surface believing validation was lost — it
was not.

Input: JSON from stdin with `last_assistant_message` (preferred, SDK v2.1.47+),
       `transcript` (fallback), `agent_type` (the role-class gate field, #812),
       `stop_hook_active` (loop guard, see main()), and `session_id` (telemetry
       journal resolution, see main())
Output: JSON `{"decision": "block", "reason": ...}` refusing the stop when the
        handoff is missing/low-quality; `systemMessage` warning instead when
        `stop_hook_active` is set; `{"suppressOutput": true}` on every
        pass/skip path; an internal error prints `hook_error_json`'s
        `systemMessage` instead (fail-open, exit 0)
