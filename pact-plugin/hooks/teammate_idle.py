Summary: TeammateIdle hook — resource-management for zombie teammates,
         plus the #1625 unflagged-background Layer 2/3 advisory.
         Tracks consecutive idle events for teammates whose task is
         completed; at threshold N=3 suggests shutdown, at N=5 advises the
         team-lead to `TaskStop` the teammate. Separately, when a teammate
         idles in_progress with outstanding recorded Bash background work
         and no valid intentional_wait, emits a once-at-N=3 advisory.
Used by: hooks.json TeammateIdle hook

# livelock-safe: two emission classes, both threshold-gated.
# (1) completed-task zombie: messages only at IDLE_SUGGEST_THRESHOLD and
#     IDLE_FORCE_THRESHOLD; per-tick re-emit only after FORCE until TaskStop.
# (2) unflagged-background: systemMessage once at consecutive idle N=3
#     (separate counter file unflagged_background_idle.json — idle_counts.json
#     pops the teammate key on every in_progress tick). No re-emit on later
#     ticks. No IDLE_PREAMBLE on this advisory (the zombie "no response
#     needed" line would contradict SET-a-wait).
# suppressOutput on every other path. Exits deterministically. Consumes
# intentional_wait only for class (2) via the U1 fire predicate.

Idle cleanup: Track consecutive idle events for completed agents. After 3,
suggest shutdown. After 5, advise the team-lead to `TaskStop` the teammate.

Input: JSON from stdin with teammate_name, team_name
Output: JSON with systemMessage (shutdown suggestion / stop advisory /
        unflagged-background Layer 2/3 advisory)
