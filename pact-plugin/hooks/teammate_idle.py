Summary: TeammateIdle hook — resource-management for zombie teammates.
         Tracks consecutive idle events for teammates whose task is
         completed; at threshold N=3 suggests shutdown, at N=5 advises the
         team-lead to `TaskStop` the teammate.
Used by: hooks.json TeammateIdle hook

# livelock-safe: threshold-escalation, not a nag. Message emissions
# transition only at the IDLE_SUGGEST_THRESHOLD and IDLE_FORCE_THRESHOLD
# boundaries — not every idle tick. Above IDLE_FORCE_THRESHOLD the stop
# advisory is re-emitted per tick until the team-lead processes it and the
# teammate is stopped (safety is protocol-level, not a structural cap).
# Exits deterministically on every code path. Does NOT consume
# intentional_wait.

Idle cleanup: Track consecutive idle events for completed agents. After 3,
suggest shutdown. After 5, advise the team-lead to `TaskStop` the teammate.

Input: JSON from stdin with teammate_name, team_name
Output: JSON with systemMessage (shutdown suggestion / stop advisory)
