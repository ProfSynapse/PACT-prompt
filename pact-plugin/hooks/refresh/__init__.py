Summary: Package for extracting workflow state from JSONL transcripts.
Used by: PreCompact hook to capture state before context compaction.

This package provides transcript parsing and workflow state extraction
for the compaction refresh system. The main entry point is
`extract_workflow_state()` which returns a checkpoint-ready dict.

    Extract workflow state from a JSONL transcript file.

    Main entry point for the refresh system. Parses the transcript,
    detects any active workflow, extracts the current step and pending
    action, and builds a checkpoint dict suitable for refresh.

    Args:
        transcript_path: Absolute path to the JSONL transcript file

    Returns:
        Checkpoint dict if an active workflow is detected with confidence >= 0.3,
        None otherwise. The dict follows the checkpoint schema defined in
        the refresh plan.
