Summary: Configuration constants for the workflow refresh system.
Used by: All refresh modules for consistent threshold and limit values.

This module centralizes configuration constants that may need tuning,
keeping regex patterns and workflow definitions in patterns.py while
extracting tunable numeric values here for maintainability.
